This attack exploits subtleties in text-encoding standards such as Unicode to produce source code whose tokens are logically encoded in a different order from the one in which they are displayed, leading to vulnerabilities that cannot be perceived directly by human code reviewers.\n \n'Trojan Source' attacks, as we call them, pose an immediate threat both to first-party software and supply-chain compromise across the industry. We present working examples of Trojan-Source attacks in C, C++, C#, JavaScript, Java, Rust, Go, and Python. We propose definitive compiler-level defenses, and describe other mitigating controls that can be deployed in editors, repositories, and build pipelines while compilers are upgraded to block this attack.\n \nAdditional details can be found in our related paper and at trojansource.codes.\n \nProofs-of-Concept\n \nThis repository is divided into per-language subdirectories.

As a first-order effect, this means users of the compiler, helping programmers to write better software. Even more important, however, are the end-users.\n \nZig is intended to be used to help end-users accomplish their goals. Zig should be used to empower end-users, never to exploit them financially, or to limit their freedom to interact with hardware or software in any way.\n \nHowever, such problems are best solved with social norms, not with software licenses. Any attempt to complicate the software license of Zig would risk compromising the value Zig provides.\n \nTherefore, Zig is available under the MIT (Expat) License, and comes with a humble request: use it to make software better serve the needs of end-users.\n \nThis project redistributes code from other projects, some of which have other licenses besides MIT. Such licenses are generally similar to the MIT license for practical purposes. See the subdirectories and files inside lib/ for more details.",

When one spikes, they all spike, and when one takes a dive, they all do. Pretty much. Moreover, all coins follow Bitcoin's lead; the difference is their phase offset.\n \nSo, if coins are basically oscillating with respect to each other, it seems smart to trade the rising coin for the falling coin, and then trade back when the ratio is reversed.\n \nHow?\n \nThe trading is done in the Binance market platform, which of course, does not have markets for every altcoin pair. The workaround for this is to use a bridge currency that will complement missing pairs. The default bridge cu…",

This form of cheating is extremely hard to detect.

Our goal is to analyze the video directly using deep learning to detect if a user is receiving machine assistance.\n \nPhase 1 focuses primarily on humanized aim-assist.

This zip file is then base64 encoded into a string that is rebuilt on disk. This encoded string is then loaded into a JScript file that when executed, would rebuild the password-protected zip file on disk and execute it. This is done programmatically by using COM objects to access the GUI-based functions in Windows via the generated JScript loader, executing the loader inside the password-protected zip without having to unzip it first. By password protecting the zip file, it protects the binary from EDRs and disk-based or anti-malware scanning mechanisms.\n \n \nInstallation\n \nThe first step as always is to clone the repo.

But more depth means more sequential computation and higher latency. This begs the question -- is it possible to build high-performing ``non-deep\" neural networks? We show that it is. We show, for the first time, that a network with a depth of just 12 can achieve top-1 accuracy over 80% on ImageNet, 96% on CIFAR10, and 81% on CIFAR100. We also show that a network with a low-depth (12) backbone can achieve an AP of 48% on MS-COCO. \n\n \nIf you find our work useful, please consider citing it:\n \n@article{goyal2021nondeep,\n  title={Non-deep Networks},\n  author={Goyal, Ankit and Bochkovskiy, Alexey and Deng, Jia and Koltun, Vladlen},\n  journal={arXiv:2110.07641},\n  year={2021}\n}\n\n \nCode Coming Soon!",

          "description": "Smart NFC & ink-Display Card\n\n[L-ink]电子墨水屏NFC智能卡片\n \n \n \n这是为了解决个人使用IC卡时遇到的一些痛点设计的一个迷你NFC智能卡片，基于STM32L051和ST25DV。\n \n \n想着既然要自制这玩意那就往炫酷了做，于是很自觉地把电子墨水屏也加上了，顺手也写了个配套APP用于显示内容定制。\n \n \n总之是个比较有意思的小项目，方案不算复杂，第一版设计也存在一些值得改进的地方，后续有空会继续优化方案设计的。\n \n \n\n \n演示视频\n \nB站指路：https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1Cf4y1y7KT/\n \n项目文件说明\n \n \n \nHardware：source里面是电路原理图和PCB文件，使用Altium Designer打开；release里面是gerber文件可以直接发给厂家打样，也包含了元器件BOM表（部分IC不太常用可能要单独购买）。\n \n \nFirmware：STM32L051的固件，我提供了Clion和Keil两个版本的工程文件，源码内容是一致的，分两个版本只是因为个人对Clion爱得深沉。\n \n \n3D Model：屏幕架和外壳的3D文件，step格式一般3D建模软件都能打开编辑，STL格式用于直接3D打印。\n \n \nDAP-Link：自己设计的下载调试器的硬件和固件源码，也包括预编译的hex固件，如果你有J-Link或者ST-Link之类的下载器就不用这个了。\n \n \nAndroid：配套的APP安装包。\n \n \n固件编译说明\n \nSTM32因为使用了L0系列的MCU，所以如果你是第一次在你的电脑上开发STM32L0，那么需要先装一下L0的固件支持包，有两种方式：\n \n \n \n 使用STM32CubMX安装：\n \n \n  \n \n 使用Keil的Package Installer安装：\n \n \n  \n \n然后就不会报头文件的错误了。\n \n有几点注意的：\n \n \n \n如果想在Clion中编译工程的话可以参考我这篇教程：https://zhuanlan.zhihu.com/p/145801160\n \n \nClion中OpenOCD默认是使用ST-Link下载，其他下载器自己修改工程目录下的stlink.cfg文件\n \n \n关于硬件方案\n \n硬件方案比较简单，主要IC就两个--STM32和ST25DV，电子墨水屏是200x200的单色屏幕，我是买的微雪的（注意如果是买的几年前的库存，那驱动芯片会有点区别导致代码不通用，只要是新款的应该都没问题）。\n \nST25DV作为NFC的PHY通过I2C总线和STM32通信，主要作用有两个：能量采集以及NFC通信。注意，ST25DV只是负责和手机进行NFC通信，而不负责IC卡的读写功能，因为ST25DV只支持ISO 15693的RFID协议，而我们常用的IC卡（M1卡）是ISO 14443协议的，所以并不能直接使用这颗芯片进行IC卡模拟。\n \nIC卡的模拟功能这一版中实现得比较简单，就是直接集成了多颗UID芯片（很便宜，1~2元一片），然后和ST25DV共用NFC天线，卡片的切换是通过拨轮换挡实现的。好处在于，你可以把L-ink当作多张独立卡片的合集处理，复制和刷卡都是很直接的（使用PM3或者PN532等模块读取原卡信息并写入L-link）。当然缺点就是添加的卡片一多，按键的数量就要增加（因为每一档对应一张卡）。\n \n所以我也在改进方案，后面可能会使用支持ISO 14443协议的ST95或者ST25T系列的芯片来实现软件层面的IC卡模拟功能。\n \n另外下一个版本的硬件方案我会把黑白的电子墨水屏换成彩色的。\n \n关于配套APP\n \nAndroid APP目前只是实现了功能，这是基于我以前做的一个算法验证框架APP改的，UI还没有重新做设计，可以等后续更新。\n \n工程文件的话我后面可以把其中的核心功能模块封装成Module，然后给个Sample Project供参考使用，工作太忙等我缓过这阵子先~\n \n教程整理中...\n \n有问题先看Issue（包括已经close的），另外\n \n跟项目工程无关的问题不要发在Issues里面！跟项目工程无关的问题不要发在Issues里面！跟项目工程无关的问题不要发在Issues里面！\n \n聊天内容可以给我发评论或者私信（B站、知乎），我看到的话基本都会回复，issue里面发的话所有watch项目的人都会收到邮件，会对大家产生困扰的！\n \n \n以下是simonire修改的版本，适配新款的屏幕驱动，修改拨轮为五维按键，有需要的可以参考：\n \nhttps://github.com/simonire/L-ink_Card",
