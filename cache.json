          "description": "A unique technique to execute binaries from a password protected zip\n\nZipExec\n \nZipExec is a Proof-of-Concept (POC) tool to wrap binary-based tools into a password-protected zip file. This zip file is then base64 encoded into a string that is rebuilt on disk. This encoded string is then loaded into a JScript file that when executed, would rebuild the password-protected zip file on disk and execute it. This is done programmatically by using COM objects to access the GUI-based functions in Windows via the generated JScript loader, executing the loader inside the password-protected zip without having to unzip it first. By password protecting the zip file, it protects the binary from EDRs and disk-based or anti-malware scanning mechanisms.\n \n \nInstallation\n \nThe first step as always is to clone the repo. Before you compile ZipExec you'll need to install the dependencies. To install them, run following commands:\n \ngo get github.com/yeka/zip\n\n \nThen build it\n \ngo build ZipExec.go\n\n \nor\n \ngo get github.com/Tylous/ZipExec \n \nHelp\n \n./ZipExec -h\n\n__________.__      ___________                     \n\\____    /|__|_____\\_   _____/__  ___ ____   ____  \n  /     / |  \\____ \\|    __)_\\  \\/  // __ \\_/ ___\\ \n /     /_ |  |  |_> >        \\>    <\\  ___/\\  \\___ \n/_______ \\|__|   __/_______  /__/\\_ \\\\___  >\\___  >\n        \\/   |__|          \\/      \\/    \\/     \\/ \n                (@Tyl0us)\n\nUsage of ./ZipExec:\n  -I string\n        Path to the file containing binary to zip.\n  -O string\n        Name of output file (e.g. loader.js)\n  -sandbox\n        Enables sandbox evasion using IsDomainedJoined.",

But more depth means more sequential computation and higher latency. This begs the question -- is it possible to build high-performing ``non-deep\" neural networks? We show that it is.

It makes ffmpeg to write output to stdout. The app will read h264 stream from ffmpeg stdout.\n \n \nffmpeg output format should be h264. Browsers don't support all h264 profiles so it may not always work. Here is an example of format that works: -pix_fmt yuv420p -c:v libx264 -bsf:v h264_mp4toannexb -b:v 2M -max_delay 0 -bf 0 -f h264.\n \n \nInput SessionDescription from ffmpeg-to-webrtc into your browser\n \nWhen you see SDP in base64 format printed it means that SDP is already in copy buffer. So you can go to jsfiddle page and paste that into second text area\n \nHit 'Start Session' in jsfiddle\n \nA video should start playing in your browser below the input boxes.\n \nExamples (windows)\n \nShare camera stream\n \ngo run . -rtbufsize 100M -f dshow -i video=\"PUT_DEVICE_NAME\" -pix_fmt yuv420p -c:v libx264 -bsf:v h264_mp4toannexb -b:v 2M -max_delay 0 -bf 0 -f h264 - < SDP. There is a delay of several seconds. Should be possible to fix it with better ffmpeg configuration.\n \nTo check list of devices: ffmpeg -list_devices true -f dshow -i dummy.\n It is possible also to set a resolution and a format, for example -pixel_format yuyv422 -s 640x480. Possible formats: ffmpeg -list_options true -f dshow -i video=PUT_DEVICE_NAME.\n \nShare screen or window\n \nSee .bat files in src folder",
