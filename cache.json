Nearly a year ago I announced the Machine & Deep Learning Compendium, a Google document that I have been writing for the last 4 years. The ML Compendium contains over 500-topics, and it is over 400 pages long.\n \nThe Compendium is fully open. It is now a project on GitBook & GitHub (please star it!). I believe in knowledge sharing and the compendium will always be free to everyone.\n \nI see this compendium as a gateway, as a frequently visited resource for people of various proficiency levels, for industry data scientists, and academics. The compendium will save you countless hours googling and sifting through articles that may not give you any value.\n \nThe Compendium includes around 500 topics, that contains various summaries, links, and articles that I have read on numerous topics that I found interesting or that I had needed to learn. It include the majority of modern machine learning algorithms, statistics, feature selection, and engineering techniques, deep-learning, NLP, audio, deep & classic vision, time-series, anomaly detection, graphs, experiment management, and much more. In addition to strategic topics such as data science management and team building, and essential topics such as product management, product design, and a technology stack from a DS POV.\n \nPlease keep in mind that this is a perpetual work in progress with a variety of topics. If you feel that something should be changed, you can now easily contribute using GitBook, GitHub, or contact me.\n \nI would like to thank the following contributors: Samuel Jefroykin, Sefi Keller\n \nMany Thanks,\n Dr. Ori Cohen | LinkedIn| Medium | OriCohen.com | MLCompendium.com | book.mlcompendium.com",

Faust.js provides tooling to reduce the pains of building a headless WordPress site (namely around data fetching, authentication, previews, and SSR/SSG) while offering a pleasant experience for both developers and publishers.\n \nGetting Started\n \nFaust.js aims to be framework agnostic, so it can be used with any front-end framework. Visit one of the guides below for a starting point:\n \n \n \nGetting started with Next.js\n \n \nAs we work towards our first release, we will be introducing support for other frameworks.\n \nDocumentation\n \nVisit https://faustjs.org/docs/next/getting-started to view the full documentation.\n \nWordPress Plugin\n \nThere are two key parts to Faust.js: the NPM packages and the WordPress plugin. To take full advantage of headless, you will need to install the plugin in addition to the npm packages.\n \n📥 Download Latest Version\n \nAfter downloading the zip linked above, we recommend installing by manually uploading via the WordPress admin\n \nCommunity\n \nTo chat with other Faust.js users and the headless community as a whole, you can join the WP Engine Developers Discord.\n \nAdditionally, if you have questions or ideas, please share them on GitHub Discussions.\n \nContributing\n \nThere are many ways to contribute to this project.\n \n \n \nDiscuss open issues to help define the future of the project.\n \n \nSubmit bugs and help us verify fixes as they are checked in.\n \n \nReview and discuss the source code changes.\n \n \nContribute bug fixes",
