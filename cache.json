          "description": "ADOP: Approximate Differentiable One-Pixel Point Rendering\n \n\n Darius Rückert, Linus Franke, Marc Stamminger\n \n\n \nAbstract: We present a novel point-based, differentiable neural rendering pipeline for scene refinement and novel view synthesis. The input are an initial estimate of the point cloud and the camera parameters. The output are synthesized images from arbitrary camera poses. The point cloud rendering is performed by a differentiable renderer using multi-resolution one-pixel point rasterization. Spatial gradients of the discrete rasterization are approximated by the novel concept of ghost geometry. After rendering, the neural image pyramid is passed through a deep neural network for shading calculations and hole-filling. A differentiable, physically-based tonemapper then converts t…",

This attack exploits subtleties in text-encoding standards such as Unicode to produce source code whose tokens are logically encoded in a different order from the one in which they are displayed, leading to vulnerabilities that cannot be perceived directly by human code reviewers.\n \n'Trojan Source' attacks, as we call them, pose an immediate threat both to first-party software and supply-chain compromise across the industry. We present working examples of Trojan-Source attacks in C, C++, C#, JavaScript, Java, Rust, Go, and Python. We propose definitive compiler-level defenses, and describe other mitigating controls that can be deployed in editors, repositories, and build pipelines while compilers are upgraded to block this attack.\n \nAdditional details can be found in our related paper and at trojansource.codes.\n \nProofs-of-Concept\n \nThis repository is divided into per-language subdirectories. Each subdirectory contains a series of proofs-of-concept implementing various Trojan-Source attacks as well as a README describing the compilers/interpreters with which these attacks were verified.\n \nAttack Detection\n \nInterested in analyzing source code files for the presence of Trojan Source attacks?

As a first-order effect, this means users of the compiler, helping programmers to write better software. Even more important, however, are the end-users.\n \nZig is intended to be used to help end-users accomplish their goals. Zig should be used to empower end-users, never to exploit them financially, or to limit their freedom to interact with hardware or software in any way.\n \nHowever, such problems are best solved with social norms, not with software licenses. Any attempt to complicate the software license of Zig would risk compromising the value Zig provides.\n \nTherefore, Zig is available under the MIT (Expat) License, and comes with a humble request: use it to make software better serve the needs of end-users.\n \nThis project redistributes code from other projects, some of which have other licenses besides MIT. Such licenses are generally similar to the MIT license for practical purposes. See the subdirectories and files inside lib/ for more details.",

          "description": "A unique technique to execute binaries from a password protected zip\n\nZipExec\n \nZipExec is a Proof-of-Concept (POC) tool to wrap binary-based tools into a password-protected zip file. This zip file is then base64 encoded into a string that is rebuilt on disk. This encoded string is then loaded into a JScript file that when executed, would rebuild the password-protected zip file on disk and execute it. This is done programmatically by using COM objects to access the GUI-based functions in Windows via the generated JScript loader, executing the loader inside the password-protected zip without having to unzip it first. By password protecting the zip file, it protects the binary from EDRs and disk-based or anti-malware scanning mechanisms.\n \n \nInstallation\n \nThe first step as always is to clone the repo. Before you compile ZipExec you'll need to install the dependencies. To install them, run following commands:\n \ngo get github.com/yeka/zip\n\n \nThen build it\n \ngo build ZipExec.go\n\n \nor\n \ngo get github.com/Tylous/ZipExec \n \nHelp\n \n./ZipExec -h\n\n__________.__      ___________                     \n\\____    /|__|_____\\_   _____/__  ___ ____   ____  \n  /     / |  \\____ \\|    __)_\\  \\/  // __ \\_/ ___\\ \n /     /_ |  |  |_> >        \\>    <\\  ___/\\  \\___ \n/_______ \\|__|   __/_______  /__/\\_ \\\\___  >\\___  >\n        \\/   |__|          \\/      \\/    \\/     \\/ \n                (@Tyl0us)\n\nUsage of ./ZipExec:\n  -I string\n        Path to the file containing binary to zip.\n  -O string\n        Name of output file (e.g. loader.js)\n  -sandbox\n        Enables sandbox evasion using IsDomainedJoined.",

But more depth means more sequential computation and higher latency. This begs the question -- is it possible to build high-performing ``non-deep\" neural networks? We show that it is.
