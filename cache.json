This repository demonstrates using neural networks for animating biped locomotion, quadruped locomotion, and character-scene interactions with objects and the environment, plus sports and fighting games. Further advances on this research will continue be…",

It makes ffmpeg to write output to stdout. The app will read h264 stream from ffmpeg stdout.\n \n \nffmpeg output format should be h264. Browsers don't support all h264 profiles so it may not always work. Here is an example of format that works: -pix_fmt yuv420p -c:v libx264 -bsf:v h264_mp4toannexb -b:v 2M -max_delay 0 -bf 0 -f h264.\n \n \nInput SessionDescription from ffmpeg-to-webrtc into your browser\n \nWhen you see SDP in base64 format printed it means that SDP is already in copy buffer. So you can go to jsfiddle page and paste that into second text area\n \nHit 'Start Session' in jsfiddle\n \nA video should start playing in your browser below the input boxes.\n \nExamples (windows)\n \nShare camera stream\n \ngo run . -rtbufsize 100M -f dshow -i video=\"PUT_DEVICE_NAME\" -pix_fmt yuv420p -c:v libx264 -bsf:v h264_mp4toannexb -b:v 2M -max_delay 0 -bf 0 -f h264 - < SDP. There is a delay of several seconds. Should be possible to fix it with better ffmpeg configuration.\n \nTo check list of devices: ffmpeg -list_devices true -f dshow -i dummy.\n It is possible also to set a resolution and a format, for example -pixel_format yuyv422 -s 640x480. Possible formats: ffmpeg -list_options true -f dshow -i video=PUT_DEVICE_NAME.\n \nShare screen or window\n \nSee .bat files in src folder",

It's also a good place to just keep up with the emulator, as most talk regarding development goes on over there.\n \n \nSpecial Thanks\n \nA few noteworthy teams/projects who've helped us along the way are:\n \n \n \n Ryujinx: We've used Ryujinx for reference throughout the project, the amount of accuracy of their HLE kernel implementation is what makes them such an amazing reference. The team behind the project has been really helpful with any queries we've had. It should be noted that Skyline is not based on Ryujinx.\n  \n \n Switchbrew: We've extensively used Switchbrew whether that be their wiki with it's colossal amount of information on the Switch that has saved us countless hours of time or libnx which was crucial to initial development of the emulator to ensure that our HLE kernel and sysmodule implementations were accurate.\n  \n \n Atmosphère: We've used libmesosphere as another reference for our HLE kernel, it's faithfulness to the HOS kernel helps us a lot. This makes it invaluably important for us as a tool for writing code that can accurately emulate HOS behavior without missing any crucial parts.\n  \n \n \nDisclaimer\n \n \n \nNintendo Switch is a trademark of Nintendo Co., Ltd\n \n \nAndroid is a trademark of Google LLC",

I believe in knowledge sharing and the compendium will always be free to everyone.\n \nI see this compendium as a gateway, as a frequently visited resource for people of various proficiency levels, for industry data scientists, and academics. The compendium will save you countless hours googling and sifting through articles that may not give you any value.\n \nThe Compendium includes around 500 topics, that contains various summaries, links, and articles that I have read on numerous topics that I found interesting or that I had needed to learn. It include the majority of modern machine learning algorithms, statistics, feature selection, and engineering techniques, deep-learning, NLP, audio, deep & classic vision, time-series, anomaly detection, graphs, experiment management, and much more. In addition to strategic topics such as data science management and team building, and essential topics such as product management, product design, and a technology stack from a DS POV.\n \nPlease keep in mind that this is a perpetual work in progress with a variety of topics.

Faust.js provides tooling to reduce the pains of building a headless WordPress site (namely around data fetching, authentication, previews, and SSR/SSG) while offering a pleasant experience for both developers and publishers.\n \nGetting Started\n \nFaust.js aims to be framework agnostic, so it can be used with any front-end framework. Visit one of the guides below for a starting point:\n \n \n \nGetting started with Next.js\n \n \nAs we work towards our first release, we will be introducing support for other frameworks.\n \nDocumentation\n \nVisit https://faustjs.org/docs/next/getting-started to view the full documentation.\n \nWordPress Plugin\n \nThere are two key parts to Faust.js: the NPM packages and the WordPress plugin. To take full advantage of headless, you will need to install the plugin in addition to the npm packages.\n \n📥 Download Latest Version\n \nAfter downloading the zip linked above, we recommend installing by manually uploading via the WordPress admin\n \nCommunity\n \nTo chat with other Faust.js users and the headless community as a whole, you can join the WP Engine Developers Discord.\n \nAdditionally, if you have questions or ideas, please share them on GitHub Discussions.\n \nContributing\n \nThere are many ways to contribute to this project.\n \n \n \nDiscuss open issues to help define the future of the project.\n \n \nSubmit bugs and help us verify fixes as they are checked in.\n \n \nReview and discuss the source code changes.\n \n \nContribute bug fixes",
