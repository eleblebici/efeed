It has a very diverse ecosystem with hundreds of great libraries for literally anything you might need. However, it can be overwhelming to be forced to make so many choices. It is also very flexible, you can write React applications in any way you like but that flexibility comes with a cost. Since there is no pre-defined architecture developers can follow, it often leads to messy, inconsistent, or over-complicated codebases.\n \nThis is an attempt to present a way of creating React applicati…",

          "description": "Android 工程师进阶手册（8 年 Android 开发者的成长感悟）\n\nAndroidDeveloperAdvancedManual\n \nAndroid 工程师进阶手册（8 年 Android 开发者的成长感悟）\n \n2021 年是我做 Android 开发的第 8 年了，随着工作的不断深入，我越来越发现对于多数工程师来说，除了把技术能力搞好之外，更需要学习如何沟通，如何思考以及如何在职场中协调资源。这些能力反而更决定了一个工程师发展的上限。为此我写了这本小册子，这里我把 Android 开发的进阶分为了三个阶段，初级，中级和高级。这只是为了让读者更容易找到开始阅读的章节。在进行阅读之前，你可以先过一下整体的目录，如果你对某个阶段的内容早已了然于心，那么可以跳过这个阶段阅读。如果整本手册都没有感兴趣的话题，当然也就不必再看下去了。\n \n如果你有任何想法或者问题，可以通过提 issue 的方式跟我交流，同时也欢迎关注我的公众号：SkyKai ，期待你的交流！\n \n第一部分、初级工程师进阶\n \n初级工程师的首要任务是提高工作能力，努力向中高级工程师进阶。这个过程艰难且漫长，需要一步一个脚印的往上走，最终才能成为高级工程师。 第一个脚印就是成为能出色完成上级布置的任务，能独立排查问题，态度积极，乐于迎接挑战的工程师。 我给优秀初级工程师的定义为：“又快又好”，其中“快”指需求完成的速度快，问题响应的速度快，问题解决的速度快等等。而“好”指代码编写的质量好，工作态度好，任务完成度好等等。 接下来我将从认知篇，知识篇与职场篇，来聊聊初级工程师如何进阶。\n \n认知篇\n \n \n \n1.1 遇到问题应该怎么办？\n \n \n1.2 优秀工程师离不开 GitHub\n \n \n1.3 反编译不是高级技巧\n \n \n1.4 学会调试\n \n \n1.5 对自己的代码负责\n \n \n知识篇\n \n \n \n2.1 Activity 与 Fragment\n \n \n2.2 Handler 消息机制\n \n \n2.3 理解 View 体系\n \n \n2.4 自定义 View\n \n \n2.5 动画机制\n \n \n2.6 线程与进程\n \n \n职场篇\n \n \n \n3.1 职场注意事项\n \n \n3.2 需求开发的完整流程\n \n \n3.3 什么时候跳槽？\n \n \n3.4 要努力进大厂吗？\n \n \n3.5 如何准备面试？\n \n \n3.6 如何选择 Offer ？\n \n \n第二部分、中级工程师进阶\n \n初级工程师只要又快又好的完成任务就可以，中级工程师阶段不仅要又快又好，还要能独当一面。独当一面是要能独立负责一个项目，或者一个独立业务。并在遇到问题时可以独立解决，成为最熟悉自己负责业务的那个人。 中级工程师开始要注重代码规范，学习更底层的知识，一般还要指导初级工程师。同时要懂得更多职场规则，并做好长远的职业规划。\n \n认知篇\n \n \n \n4.1 如何引入开源项目\n \n \n4.2 如何快速排查问题\n \n \n4.3 怎样写出漂亮的代码\n \n \n4.4 怎样写好注释\n \n \n4.5 代码出 Bug 该怎么办？\n \n \n4.6 怎样才能少出 Bug ？\n \n \n4.7 业务开发与架构开发\n \n \n知识篇\n \n \n \n5.1 进程间通信\n \n \n5.2 热修复技术\n \n \n5.3 常用设计模式\n \n \n5.4 常用架构模式\n \n \n5.5 如何优化应用启动性能\n \n \n5.6 经典开源项目解析\n \n \n职场篇\n \n \n \n6.1 职场沟通技巧\n \n \n6.2 做好一个需求的要点\n \n \n6.3 做好长期规划\n \n \n6.4 要不要拒绝 996 ？\n \n \n第三部分、高级工程师进阶\n \n高级工程师阶段，无论是编程能力还是业务能力，你都具有了一些不可替代性。你通常负责新技术的预研，重要需求推进以及新项目的技术选型。高级工程师会让老板和同事觉得：非你不可。你更多的时间是在解决别人解决不了的事情，尝试业界还未尝试过的方案以及帮助其他工程师成长。 到了这个阶段编程语言已经不重要了，一切选择都为了业务更好的发展。同时也要考虑更多代码之外的事情了。\n \n认知篇\n \n \n \n7.1 高级工程师的特点\n \n \n7.2 参与开源项目\n \n \n7.3 如何判断技术发展趋势\n \n \n知识篇\n \n \n \n8.1 了解跨平台开发\n \n \n8.2 Flutter 是跨平台的未来吗？\n \n \n8.3 最优跨平台方案是什么？\n \n \n8.4 大型项目架构解析\n \n \n8.5 构建移动开发平台\n \n \n职场篇\n \n \n \n9.1 如何成为项目核心\n \n \n9.2 工资要存起来，理财还是买房？\n \n \n9.3 如何面对35岁问题",

This attack exploits subtleties in text-encoding standards such as Unicode to produce source code whose tokens are logically encoded in a different order from the one in which they are displayed, leading to vulnerabilities that cannot be perceived directly by human code reviewers.\n \n'Trojan Source' attacks, as we call them, pose an immediate threat both to first-party software and supply-chain compromise across the industry. We present working examples of Trojan-Source attacks in C, C++, C#, JavaScript, Java, Rust, Go, and Python. We propose definitive compiler-level defenses, and describe other mitigating controls that can be deployed in editors, repositories, and build pipelines while compilers are upgraded to block this attack.\n \nAdditional details can be found in our related paper and at trojansource.codes.\n \nProofs-of-Concept\n \nThis repository is divided into per-language subdirectories. Each subdirectory contains a series of proofs-of-concept implementing various Trojan-Source attacks as well as a README describing the compilers/interpreters with which these attacks were verified.\n \nAttack Detection\n \nInterested in analyzing source code files for the presence of Trojan Source attacks? Check out this repo, which visualizes bidirectional overrides.",

As a first-order effect, this means users of the compiler, helping programmers to write better software. Even more important, however, are the end-users.\n \nZig is intended to be used to help end-users accomplish their goals. Zig should be used to empower end-users, never to exploit them financially, or to limit their freedom to interact with hardware or software in any way.\n \nHowever, such problems are best solved with social norms, not with software licenses. Any attempt to complicate the software license of Zig would risk compromising the value Zig provides.\n \nTherefore, Zig is available under the MIT (Expat) License, and comes with a humble request: use it to make software better serve the needs of end-users.\n \nThis project redistributes code from other projects, some of which have other licenses besides MIT. Such licenses are generally similar to the MIT license for practical purposes. See the subdirectories and files inside lib/ for more details.",

When one spikes, they all spike, and when one takes a dive, they all do. Pretty much. Moreover, all coins follow Bitcoin's lead; the difference is their phase offset.\n \nSo, if coins are basically oscillating with respect to each other, it seems smart to trade the rising coin for the falling coin, and then trade back when the ratio is reversed.\n \nHow?\n \nThe trading is done in the Binance market platform, which of course, does not have markets for every altcoin pair. The workaround for this is to use a bridge currency that will complement missing pairs. The default bridge cu…",

Our goal is to analyze the video directly using deep learning to detect if a user is receiving machine assistance.\n \nPhase 1 focuses primarily on humanized aim-assist.

This zip file is then base64 encoded into a string that is rebuilt on disk. This encoded string is then loaded into a JScript file that when executed, would rebuild the password-protected zip file on disk and execute it. This is done programmatically by using COM objects to access the GUI-based functions in Windows via the generated JScript loader, executing the loader inside the password-protected zip without having to unzip it first. By password protecting the zip file, it protects the binary from EDRs and disk-based or anti-malware scanning mechanisms.\n \n \nInstallation\n \nThe first step as always is to clone the repo.

But more depth means more sequential computation and higher latency. This begs the question -- is it possible to build high-performing ``non-deep\" neural networks? We show that it is. We show, for the first time, that a network with a depth of just 12 can achieve top-1 accuracy over 80% on ImageNet, 96% on CIFAR10, and 81% on CIFAR100. We also show that a network with a low-depth (12) backbone can achieve an AP of 48% on MS-COCO. \n\n \nIf you find our work useful, please consider citing it:\n \n@article{goyal2021nondeep,\n  title={Non-deep Networks},\n  author={Goyal, Ankit and Bochkovskiy, Alexey and Deng, Jia and Koltun, Vladlen},\n  journal={arXiv:2110.07641},\n  year={2021}\n}\n\n \nCode Coming Soon!",
