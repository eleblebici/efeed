It makes ffmpeg to write output to stdout. The app will read h264 stream from ffmpeg stdout.\n \n \nffmpeg output format should be h264. Browsers don't support all h264 profiles so it may not always work. Here is an example of format that works: -pix_fmt yuv420p -c:v libx264 -bsf:v h264_mp4toannexb -b:v 2M -max_delay 0 -bf 0 -f h264.\n \n \nInput SessionDescription from ffmpeg-to-webrtc into your browser\n \nWhen you see SDP in base64 format printed it means that SDP is already in copy buffer. So you can go to jsfiddle page and paste that into second text area\n \nHit 'Start Session' in jsfiddle\n \nA video should start playing in your browser below the input boxes.\n \nExamples (windows)\n \nShare camera stream\n \ngo run . -rtbufsize 100M -f dshow -i video=\"PUT_DEVICE_NAME\" -pix_fmt yuv420p -c:v libx264 -bsf:v h264_mp4toannexb -b:v 2M -max_delay 0 -bf 0 -f h264 - < SDP. There is a delay of several seconds. Should be possible to fix it with better ffmpeg configuration.\n \nTo check list of devices: ffmpeg -list_devices true -f dshow -i dummy.\n It is possible also to set a resolution and a format, for example -pixel_format yuyv422 -s 640x480. Possible formats: ffmpeg -list_options true -f dshow -i video=PUT_DEVICE_NAME.\n \nShare screen or window\n \nSee .bat files in src folder",

          "description": "基于深度强化学习的原神自动钓鱼AI\n\nIntroduction\n \n原神自动钓鱼AI由YOLOX, DQN两部分模型组成。使用迁移学习，半监督学习进行训练。 模型也包含一些使用opencv等传统数字图像处理方法实现的不可学习部分。\n \n其中YOLOX用于鱼的定位和类型的识别以及鱼竿落点的定位。DQN用于自适应控制钓鱼过程的点击，让力度落在最佳区域内。\n \n安装使用流程\n \n安装python运行环境（解释器），推荐使用 anaconda.\n \npython环境配置\n \n打开anaconda prompt(命令行界面)，创建新python环境并激活:\n \nconda create -n ysfish python=3.6\nconda activate ysfish\n\n \n推荐安装python3.7或以下版本。\n \n下载工程代码\n \n使用git下载，git安装教程:\n \ngit clone https://github.com/7eu7d7/genshin_auto_fish.git\n\n \n或直接在github网页端下载后直接解压。\n \n依赖库安装\n \n切换命令行到本工程所在目录:\n \ncd genshin_auto_fish\n\n \n执行以下命令安装依赖:\n \npython -m pip install -U pip\npython requirements.py\n\n \n如果要使用显卡进行加速需要 安装CUDA和cudnn 安装后无视上面的命令用下面这条安装gpu版:\n \npip install -U pip\npython requirements.py --cuda [cuda版本]\n#例如安装的CUDA11.x\npython requirements.py --cuda 110\n\n \n可能会有Time out之类的报错，多试几遍，github太卡。\n \n安装yolox\n \n切换命令行到本工程所在目录，执行以下命令安装yolox:\n \npython setup.py develop\n\n \n预训练权重下载\n \n下载预训练权重 (.pth文件),yolox_tiny.pth 下载后将权重文件放在 工程目录/weights 下\n \nYOLOX训练工作流程\n \n<只用来钓鱼不需要训练，直接用预训练权重就可以>\n \nYOLOX部分因为打标签太累所以用半监督学习。标注少量样本后训练模型生成其余样本伪标签再人工修正，不断迭代提高精度。 样本量较少所以使用迁移学习，在COCO预训练的模型上进行fine-tuning.\n \n下载数据集并解压：原神鱼群数据集, 数据集(迅雷云盘:ugha)\n \n将yolox/exp/yolox_tiny_fish.py中的self.data_dir的值改为解压后2个文件夹所在的路径。\n \n训练代码:\n \npython yolox_tools/train.py -f yolox/exp/yolox_tiny_fish.py -d 1 -b 8 --fp16 -o -c weights/yolox_tiny.pth\n\n \nDQN训练工作流程\n \n控制力度使用强化学习模型DQN进行训练。两次进度的差值作为reward为模型提供学习方向。模型与环境间交互式学习。\n \n直接在原神内训练耗时较长，太累了。首先制作一个仿真环境，大概模拟钓鱼力度控制操作。在仿真环境内预训练一个模型。 随后将这一模型迁移至原神内，实现域间迁移。\n \n仿真环境预训练代码:\n \npython train_sim.py\n\n \n原神游戏内训练:\n \npython train.py\n\n \n运行钓鱼AI\n \n命令行窗口一定要以管理员权限启动\n \n显卡加速\n \npython fishing.py image -f yolox/exp/yolox_tiny_fish.py -c weights/best_tiny3.pth --conf 0.25 --nms 0.45 --tsize 640 --device gpu\n\n \ncpu运行\n \npython fishing.py image -f yolox/exp/yolox_tiny_fish.py -c weights/best_tiny3.pth --conf 0.25 --nms 0.45 --tsize 640 --device cpu\n\n \n运行后出现init ok后按r键开始钓鱼，原神需要全屏。出于性能考虑检测框不会实时显示，处理运算后台进行。",

The team behind the project has been really helpful with any queries we've had. It should be noted that Skyline is not based on Ryujinx.\n  \n \n Switchbrew: We've extensively used Switchbrew whether that be their wiki with it's colossal amount of information on the Switch that has saved us countless hours of time or libnx which was crucial to initial development of the emulator to ensure that our HLE kernel and sysmodule implementations were accurate.\n  \n \n Atmosphère: We've used libmesosphere as another reference for our HLE kernel, it's faithfulness to the HOS kernel helps us a lot. This makes it invaluably important for us as a tool for writing code that can accurately emulate HOS behavior without missing any crucial parts.\n  \n \n \nDisclaimer\n \n \n \nNintendo Switch is a trademark of Nintendo Co., Ltd\n \n \nAndroid is a trademark of Google LLC",

The ML Compendium contains over 500-topics, and it is over 400 pages long.\n \nThe Compendium is fully open. It is now a project on GitBook & GitHub (please star it!). I believe in knowledge sharing and the compendium will always be free to everyone.\n \nI see this compendium as a gateway, as a frequently visited resource for people of various proficiency levels, for industry data scientists, and academics. The compendium will save you countless hours googling and sifting through articles that may not give you any value.\n \nThe Compendium includes around 500 topics, that contains various summaries, links, and articles that I have read on numerous topics that I found interesting or that I had needed to learn. It include the majority of modern machine learning algorithms, statistics, feature selection, and engineering techniques, deep-learning, NLP, audio, deep & classic vision, time-series, anomaly detection, graphs, experiment management, and much more. In addition to strategic topics such as data science management and team building, and essential topics such as product management, product design, and a technology stack from a DS POV.\n \nPlease keep in mind that this is a perpetual work in progress with a variety of topics. If you feel that something should be changed, you can now easily contribute using GitBook, GitHub, or contact me.\n \nI would like to thank the following contributors: Samuel Jefroykin, Sefi Keller\n \nMany Thanks,\n Dr. Ori Cohen | LinkedIn| Medium | OriCohen.com | MLCompendium.com | book.mlcompendium.com",

As we work towards our first release, we will 💯 introduce breaking changes.  \n \n  \nFaust.js\n  \n\n \n       \n \n    \n        \n \nIntroduction\n \nFaust.js is a framework for building front-end applications for headless WordPress sites. Faust.js provides tooling to reduce the pains of building a headless WordPress site (namely around data fetching, authentication, previews, and SSR/SSG) while offering a pleasant experience for both developers and publishers.\n \nGetting Started\n \nFaust.js aims to be framework agnostic, so it can be used with any front-end framework. Visit one of the guides below for a starting point:\n \n \n \nGetting started with Next.js\n \n \nAs we work towards our first release, we will be introducing support for other frameworks.\n \nDocumentation\n \nVisit https://faustjs.org/docs/next/getting-started to view the full documentation.\n \nWordPress Plugin\n \nThere are two key parts to Faust.js: the NPM packages and the WordPress plugin. To take full advantage of headless, you will need to install the plugin in addition to the npm packages.\n \n📥 Download Latest Version\n \nAfter downloading the zip linked above, we recommend installing by manually uploading via the WordPress admin\n \nCommunity\n \nTo chat with other Faust.js users and the headless community as a whole, you can join the WP Engine Developers Discord.\n \nAdditionally, if you have questions or ideas, please share them on GitHub Discussions.\n \nContributing\n \nThere are many ways to contribute to this project.\n \n \n \nDiscuss open issues to help define the future of the project.\n \n \nSubmit bugs and help us verify fixes as they are checked in.\n \n \nReview and discuss the source code changes.\n \n \nContribute bug fixes",
