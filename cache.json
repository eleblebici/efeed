          "description": "Smart NFC & ink-Display Card\n\n[L-ink]电子墨水屏NFC智能卡片\n \n \n \n这是为了解决个人使用IC卡时遇到的一些痛点设计的一个迷你NFC智能卡片，基于STM32L051和ST25DV。\n \n \n想着既然要自制这玩意那就往炫酷了做，于是很自觉地把电子墨水屏也加上了，顺手也写了个配套APP用于显示内容定制。\n \n \n总之是个比较有意思的小项目，方案不算复杂，第一版设计也存在一些值得改进的地方，后续有空会继续优化方案设计的。\n \n \n\n \n演示视频\n \nB站指路：https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1Cf4y1y7KT/\n \n项目文件说明\n \n \n \nHardware：source里面是电路原理图和PCB文件，使用Altium Designer打开；release里面是gerber文件可以直接发给厂家打样，也包含了元器件BOM表（部分IC不太常用可能要单独购买）。\n \n \nFirmware：STM32L051的固件，我提供了Clion和Keil两个版本的工程文件，源码内容是一致的，分两个版本只是因为个人对Clion爱得深沉。\n \n \n3D Model：屏幕架和外壳的3D文件，step格式一般3D建模软件都能打开编辑，STL格式用于直接3D打印。\n \n \nDAP-Link：自己设计的下载调试器的硬件和固件源码，也包括预编译的hex固件，如果你有J-Link或者ST-Link之类的下载器就不用这个了。\n \n \nAndroid：配套的APP安装包。\n \n \n固件编译说明\n \nSTM32因为使用了L0系列的MCU，所以如果你是第一次在你的电脑上开发STM32L0，那么需要先装一下L0的固件支持包，有两种方式：\n \n \n \n 使用STM32CubMX安装：\n \n \n  \n \n 使用Keil的Package Installer安装：\n \n \n  \n \n然后就不会报头文件的错误了。\n \n有几点注意的：\n \n \n \n如果想在Clion中编译工程的话可以参考我这篇教程：https://zhuanlan.zhihu.com/p/145801160\n \n \nClion中OpenOCD默认是使用ST-Link下载，其他下载器自己修改工程目录下的stlink.cfg文件\n \n \n关于硬件方案\n \n硬件方案比较简单，主要IC就两个--STM32和ST25DV，电子墨水屏是200x200的单色屏幕，我是买的微雪的（注意如果是买的几年前的库存，那驱动芯片会有点区别导致代码不通用，只要是新款的应该都没问题）。\n \nST25DV作为NFC的PHY通过I2C总线和STM32通信，主要作用有两个：能量采集以及NFC通信。注意，ST25DV只是负责和手机进行NFC通信，而不负责IC卡的读写功能，因为ST25DV只支持ISO 15693的RFID协议，而我们常用的IC卡（M1卡）是ISO 14443协议的，所以并不能直接使用这颗芯片进行IC卡模拟。\n \nIC卡的模拟功能这一版中实现得比较简单，就是直接集成了多颗UID芯片（很便宜，1~2元一片），然后和ST25DV共用NFC天线，卡片的切换是通过拨轮换挡实现的。好处在于，你可以把L-ink当作多张独立卡片的合集处理，复制和刷卡都是很直接的（使用PM3或者PN532等模块读取原卡信息并写入L-link）。当然缺点就是添加的卡片一多，按键的数量就要增加（因为每一档对应一张卡）。\n \n所以我也在改进方案，后面可能会使用支持ISO 14443协议的ST95或者ST25T系列的芯片来实现软件层面的IC卡模拟功能。\n \n另外下一个版本的硬件方案我会把黑白的电子墨水屏换成彩色的。\n \n关于配套APP\n \nAndroid APP目前只是实现了功能，这是基于我以前做的一个算法验证框架APP改的，UI还没有重新做设计，可以等后续更新。\n \n工程文件的话我后面可以把其中的核心功能模块封装成Module，然后给个Sample Project供参考使用，工作太忙等我缓过这阵子先~\n \n教程整理中...\n \n有问题先看Issue（包括已经close的），另外\n \n跟项目工程无关的问题不要发在Issues里面！跟项目工程无关的问题不要发在Issues里面！跟项目工程无关的问题不要发在Issues里面！\n \n聊天内容可以给我发评论或者私信（B站、知乎），我看到的话基本都会回复，issue里面发的话所有watch项目的人都会收到邮件，会对大家产生困扰的！\n \n \n以下是simonire修改的版本，适配新款的屏幕驱动，修改拨轮为五维按键，有需要的可以参考：\n \nhttps://github.com/simonire/L-ink_Card",

It makes ffmpeg to write output to stdout. The app will read h264 stream from ffmpeg stdout.\n \n \nffmpeg output format should be h264. Browsers don't support all h264 profiles so it may not always work. Here is an example of format that works: -pix_fmt yuv420p -c:v libx264 -bsf:v h264_mp4toannexb -b:v 2M -max_delay 0 -bf 0 -f h264.\n \n \nInput SessionDescription from ffmpeg-to-webrtc into your browser\n \nWhen you see SDP in base64 format printed it means that SDP is already in copy buffer. So you can go to jsfiddle page and paste that into second text area\n \nHit 'Start Session' in jsfiddle\n \nA video should start playing in your browser below the input boxes.\n \nExamples (windows)\n \nShare camera stream\n \ngo run . -rtbufsize 100M -f dshow -i video=\"PUT_DEVICE_NAME\" -pix_fmt yuv420p -c:v libx264 -bsf:v h264_mp4toannexb -b:v 2M -max_delay 0 -bf 0 -f h264 - < SDP. There is a delay of several seconds. Should be possible to fix it with better ffmpeg configuration.\n \nTo check list of devices: ffmpeg -list_devices true -f dshow -i dummy.\n It is possible also to set a resolution and a format, for example -pixel_format yuyv422 -s 640x480. Possible formats: ffmpeg -list_options true -f dshow -i video=PUT_DEVICE_NAME.\n \nShare screen or window\n \nSee .bat files in src folder",

Folly contains a variety of core library components used extensively at Facebook. In particular, it's often a dependency of Facebook's other open source C++ efforts and place where those projects can share code.\n \nIt complements (as opposed to competing against) offerings such as Boost and of course std. In fact, we embark on defining our own component only when something we need is either not available, or does not meet the needed performance profile. We endeavor to remove things from folly if or when std or Boost obsoletes them.\n …",

The ML Compendium contains over 500-topics, and it is over 400 pages long.\n \nThe Compendium is fully open. It is now a project on GitBook & GitHub (please star it!). I believe in knowledge sharing and the compendium will always be free to everyone.\n \nI see this compendium as a gateway, as a frequently visited resource for people of various proficiency levels, for industry data scientists, and academics. The compendium will save you countless hours googling and sifting through articles that may not give you any value.\n \nThe Compendium includes around 500 topics, that contains various summaries, links, and articles that I have read on numerous topics that I found interesting or that I had needed to learn. It include the majority of modern machine learning algorithms, statistics, feature selection, and engineering techniques, deep-learning, NLP, audio, deep & classic vision, time-series, anomaly detection, graphs, experiment management, and much more. In addition to strategic topics such as data science management and team building, and essential topics such as product management, product design, and a technology stack from a DS POV.\n \nPlease keep in mind that this is a perpetual work in progress with a variety of topics.

Faust.js provides tooling to reduce the pains of building a headless WordPress site (namely around data fetching, authentication, previews, and SSR/SSG) while offering a pleasant experience for both developers and publishers.\n \nGetting Started\n \nFaust.js aims to be framework agnostic, so it can be used with any front-end framework. Visit one of the guides below for a starting point:\n \n \n \nGetting started with Next.js\n \n \nAs we work towards our first release, we will be introducing support for other frameworks.\n \nDocumentation\n \nVisit https://faustjs.org/docs/next/getting-started to view the full documentation.\n \nWordPress Plugin\n \nThere are two key parts to Faust.js: the NPM packages and the WordPress plugin. To take full advantage of headless, you will need to install the plugin in addition to the npm packages.\n \n📥 Download Latest Version\n \nAfter downloading the zip linked above, we recommend installing by manually uploading via the WordPress admin\n \nCommunity\n \nTo chat with other Faust.js users and the headless community as a whole, you can join the WP Engine Developers Discord.\n \nAdditionally, if you have questions or ideas, please share them on GitHub Discussions.\n \nContributing\n \nThere are many ways to contribute to this project.\n \n \n \nDiscuss open issues to help define the future of the project.\n \n \nSubmit bugs and help us verify fixes as they are checked in.\n \n \nReview and discuss the source code changes.\n \n \nContribute bug fixes",
