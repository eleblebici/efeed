Weighing just about 39 KB of gzipped JS plus 4 KB of gzipped CSS code, it has all the mapping features most developers ever need.\n \nLeaflet is designed with simplicity, performance and usability in mind. It works efficiently across all major desktop and mobile platforms out of the box, taking advantage of HTML5 and CSS3 on modern browsers while being accessible on older ones too. It can be extended with a huge amount of plugins, has a beautiful, easy to use and well-documented API and a simple, readable source code that is a joy to contribute to.\n \nFor more info, docs and tutorials, check out the official website.\n For Leaflet downloads (including the built master version), check out the download page.\n \nWe're happy to meet new contributors.

This zip file is then base64 encoded into a string that is rebuilt on disk. This encoded string is then loaded into a JScript file that when executed, would rebuild the password-protected zip file on disk and execute it. This is done programmatically by using COM objects to access the GUI-based functions in Windows via the generated JScript loader, executing the loader inside the password-protected zip without having to unzip it first. By password protecting the zip file, it protects the binary from EDRs and disk-based or anti-malware scanning mechanisms.\n \n \nInstallation\n \nThe first step as always is to clone the repo.

But more depth means more sequential computation and higher latency. This begs the question -- is it possible to build high-performing ``non-deep\" neural networks? We show that it is. We show, for the first time, that a network with a depth of just 12 can achieve top-1 accuracy over 80% on ImageNet, 96% on CIFAR10, and 81% on CIFAR100. We also show that a network with a low-depth (12) backbone can achieve an AP of 48% on MS-COCO. \n\n \nIf you find our work useful, please consider citing it:\n \n@article{goyal2021nondeep,\n  title={Non-deep Networks},\n  author={Goyal, Ankit and Bochkovskiy, Alexey and Deng, Jia and Koltun, Vladlen},\n  journal={arXiv:2110.07641},\n  year={2021}\n}\n\n \nCode Coming Soon!",

This manifests itself as, e.g., detail appearing to be glued to image coordinates instead of the surfaces of depicted objects. We trace the root cause to careless signal processing that causes aliasing in the generator network. Interpreting all signals…",
