Docker Compose v2
 

 

 
Docker Compose is a tool for running multi-container applications on Docker defined using the Compose file format. A Compose file is used to define how the one or more containers that make up your application are configured. Once you have a Compose file, you can create and start your application with a single command: docker compose up.
 
About update and backward compatibility
 
Docker Compose V2 is a major version bump release of Docker compose. It has been completely rewriten from scratch in Golang (V1 was in Python). The installation instructions for Compose V2 differ from V1. V2 is not a standalone binary anymore and installation scripts will have to be adjusted. Some commands are different.

Spring Boot   
 
 
 
 
  
 
   
Spring Boot helps you to create Spring-powered, production-grade applications and services with absolute minimum fuss. It takes an opinionated view of the Spring platform so that new and existing users can quickly get to the bits they need.
 
  
 
  
 
   
You can use Spring Boot to create stand-alone Java applications that can be started using java -jar or more traditional WAR deployments. We also provide a command line tool that runs Spring scripts.
 
  
 
  
 
   
Our primary goals are:
 
  
 
  
 
   
 
    
 Provide a radically faster and widely accessible getting started experience for all Spring development.
  
    
 Be opinionated, but get out of the way quickly as requirements start to diverge from the defaults.

Moya 15.0.0
 
     
 
A Chinese version of this document can be found here.
 
You're a smart developer. You probably use Alamofire to abstract away access to URLSession and all those nasty details you don't really care about. But then, like lots of smart developers, you write ad hoc network abstraction layers. They are probably called "APIManager" or "NetworkModel", and they always end in tears.
 

 
Ad hoc network layers are common in iOS apps. They're bad for a few reasons:
 
 
 
Makes it hard to write new apps ("where do I begin?")
 
 
Makes it hard to maintain existing apps ("oh my god, this mess...")
 
 
Makes it hard to write unit tests ("how do I do this again?")
 
 
So the basic idea of Moya is that we want some network abstraction …]]></summary>

 EXOCET is superior to Metasploit's "Evasive Payloads" modules as EXOCET uses AES-256 in GCM Mode (Galois/Counter Mode). Metasploit's Evasion Payloads uses a easy to detect RC4 encryption. While RC4 can decrypt faster, AES-256 is much more difficult to ascertain the intent of the malware. 
 
However, it is possible to use Metasploit to build a Evasive Payload, and then chain that with EXOCET. So EXOCET will decrypt via AES-256, and then the Metasploit Evasive Payload then decrypts itself from RC4.

 Classic modular front-end UI framework 
 
     
 --> 
 

  

--> 
 
layui 是一款采用自身模块规范编写的前端 UI 框架，遵循原生 HTML/CSS/JS 的开发方式，极易上手，拿来即用。其风格简约轻盈，而组件优雅丰盈，从源代码到使用方法的每一处细节都经过精心雕琢，非常适合网页界面的快速开发。layui 区别于那些基于 MVVM 底层的前端框架，却并非逆道而行，而是信奉返璞归真之道。准确地说，它更多是面向后端开发者，你无需涉足前端各种工具，只需面对浏览器本身，让一切你所需要的元素与交互，从这里信手拈来。
 
返璞归真
 
layui 定义为“经典模块化”，并非是自吹她自身有多优秀，而是有意避开当下 JS 社区的主流方案，试图以最简单的方式去诠释高效！她的所谓经典，是在于对返璞归真的执念，她以当前浏览器普通认可的方式去组织模块！我们认为，这恰是符合当下国内绝大多数程序员从旧时代过渡到未来新标准的最佳指引。所以 layui 本身也并不是完全遵循于 AMD 时代，准确地说，她试图建立自己的模式，所以你会看到：
 
//layui模块的定义
layui.define([mods], function(exports){
  
  //……
  
  exports('mod', api);
});  
 
//layui模块的使用
layui.use(['mod1', 'mod2'], function(args){
  var mod = layui.mod1;
  
  //……
  
});    

 
没错，她具备 AMD 的影子，又并非受限于 CommonJS 的那些条条框框，layui 认为这种轻量的组织方式，比 WebPack 更符合绝大多数场景。所以她坚持采用经典模块化，也正是能让人避开工具的复杂配置，回归简单，安静高效地撸一会原生态的HTML、CSS、JavaScript。
 
但是 layui 又并非是 Requirejs 那样的模块加载器，而是一款 UI 解决方案，她与 Bootstrap 最大的不同恰恰在于她糅合了自身对经典模块化的理解。
 
快速上手
 
获得 layui 后，将其完整地部署到你的静态资源项目目录，你只需要引入下述两个文件：
 
./layui/css/layui.css
./layui/layui.js

 
这是一个基本的入门页面：
 
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
  <meta charset="utf-8">
  <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1">
  <title>开始使用 layui</title>
  <link rel="stylesheet" href="../layui/css/layui.css">
</head>
<body>
 
<!-- 你的HTML代码 -->
 
<script src="../layui/layui.js"></script>
<script>
//一般直接写在一个js文件中
layui.use(['layer', 'form'], function(){
  var layer = layui.layer
  ,form = layui.form;
  
  layer.msg('Hello World');
});
</script> 
</body>
</html>

 
阅读文档
 
从现在开始，尽情地拥抱 layui 吧！但愿她能成为你长远的开发伴侣，化作你方寸屏幕前的亿万字节！
 
贡献者
 
 
 
大概是因为 layui 让开发者变得更懒，所以贡献者才这么少？
 好的，姑且就这样认为吧。

Operating System development tutorials in Rust on the Raspberry Pi
 
    
 
 
 
 
ℹ️ Introduction
 
This is a tutorial series for hobby OS developers who are new to ARM's 64 bit ARMv8-A architecture. The tutorials will give a guided, step-by-step tour of how to write a monolithic Operating System kernel for an embedded system from scratch. They cover implementation of common Operating Systems tasks, like writing to the serial console, setting up virtual memory and handling HW exceptions. All while leveraging Rust's unique features to provide for safety and speed.
 
Have fun!

Python - 100天从新手到大师
 
 
 
作者：骆昊
 
 
说明：从项目上线到获得8w+星标以来，一直收到反馈说基础部分（前15天的内容）对新手来说是比较困难的，建议有配套视频进行讲解。最近把基础部分的内容重新创建了一个名为“Python-Core-50-Courses”的项目，用更为简单通俗的方式重写了这部分内容并附带了视频讲解，初学者可以关注下这个新项目。国内用户如果访问GitHub比较慢的话，也可以关注我的知乎号Python-Jack上的“从零开始学Python”专栏，专栏会持续更新，还有大家比较期待的“数据分析”的内容也即将上线，欢迎大家关注我在知乎的专栏、文章和回答。

MagInkCal
 
This repo contains the code needed to drive an E-Ink Magic Calendar that uses a battery powered (PiSugar2) Raspberry Pi Zero WH to retrieve events from a Google Calendar, format it into the desired layout, before pushing it to a Waveshare 12.48" tri-color E-Ink display. Note that the code has only been tested on the specific hardware mentioned, and customization of the code is necessary for it to work with other E-Ink displays or Battery/RTC add-ons. That said, enjoy working on your project and hopefully this helps to jump-start your magic calendar journey.

Rover - Terraform Visualizer
 
Rover is a Terraform visualizer.
 
In order to do this, Rover:
 
 
 
generates a plan file and parses the configuration in the root directory or uses a provided plan.
 
 
parses the plan and configuration files to generate three items: the resource overview (rso), the resource map (map), and the resource graph (graph).
 
 
consumes the rso, map, and graph to generate an interactive configuration and state visualization hosts on 0.0.0.0:9000.
 
 
Feedback (via issues) and pull requests are appreciated!

What is Xplorer?
 

 
 
  More Screenshots  
 
 
 
 
Xplorer is a file explorer built from ground-up to be fully customizable. And even without customization, it also looks modern! It is cross-platform, built using Electron Technology that allowed our File Explorer to be run not only in Windows, but also Linux and MacOS alike. It also allowed file preview directly inside it, not only pictures or documents, but also videos!
 
To summarize, Xplorer's features contain:
 
 
 
Looks modern
 
 
Easy to use
 
 
Cross-platform
 
 
File Preview, even videos!
 
 
Most importantly, FOSS, Free and Open Source, which mean you can change components inside if you see fit
 
 
Xplorer is currently in development. Suggest improvements in Xplorer Discussions or contribute to it!

Porth
 
WARNING! This language is a work in progress!
 
It's like Forth but written in Python. But I don't actually know for sure since I never programmed in Forth, I only heard that it's some sort of stack-based programming language. Porth is also stack-based programming language. Which makes it just like Forth am I rite?
 
Porth is planned to be

 Stack-based (just like Forth)

 Self-hosted (Python is used only as an initial bootstrap, once the language is mature enough we gonna rewrite it in itself)
 
 
 Statically typed (the type checking is probably gonna be similar to the WASM validation)

Shader School
 
 
 
An introduction to GLSL shaders and graphics programming that runs in your web browser.
 

 
Running this thing
 
First, you need to get a browser with WebGL, as well as a copy of node.js and git. Once you have all of that set up, you can install the workshop using npm, which is included with node:
 
npm install -g shader-school

 
After that completes, you should be able to run the workshopper with the command:
 
shader-school

 
The script will ask you if you want to create an answer directory, press y to accept. This will populate your current directory with shader files for you to edit for each lesson – hopefully, it should also automatically open your web browser but if it doesn't you can find the workshop menu on http://localhost:12492/.
 
Stuck?
 
Feedback and criticism is welcome, please log your troubles in issues. The workshop is still being worked on but is very close to being complete!
 
Full curriculum reviews like this one are very helpful. More feedback like this please!

不使用 ![]() 这种方式来引用图片，而是用 <img> 标签。一方面是为了能够控制图片以合适的大小显示，另一方面是因为 GFM 不支持 <center> ![]() </center> 这种方法让图片居中显示，只能使用 <div align="center"> <img src=""/> </div> 达到居中的效果。

更新日志
 
 
 
2021.09.06 v1.5根据小程序的逻辑，修改了单线程版本的逻辑，使的单线程版本更加符合人为操作。
 也修改了接口返回的cookie不会覆盖手工录入的cookie bug
 在单线程版本未能成功抢到之前，不会再更新多线程版本
 关于ecc-hs参数的猜想，ecc-hs参数的加密源来源于checkstock2接口返回的st时间，而该接口返回时会设置一个cookie，类似于b0612=afedbfbcd，其中b0612很明显是跟疫苗的id有关系的，疫苗id不同，key也不同
 
 
2021.05.25 v1.4长时间未抢到，目测是加密参数ecc-hs起作用了，之前忙一直用的是假的ecc-hs，所以完善了加密参数，增加了单线程版本在single-thread分支
 
 
2020.09.25 v1.3增加了加密参数ecc-hs（目前无用），秒杀时间提前至两秒，加大了并发数量
 
 
2020.09.17 v1.2增加了地区选择功能
 
 
2020.08.14 V1.1增加了控制台模式，通过java -jar sec-kill.jar -c 进入
 优化了交互，减少了并发的数量避免操作频繁
 
 
2020.08.11 优化了req-header的解析，目测可以万能解析；优化了交互
 
 
2020.08.10 最终版，经测试已经成功抢到，不会添加新的功能了，不过后期还是会维护
 
 
2020.08.07 小程序版秒杀V1.0，基本测试99.99%（如果有BUG，那就是那0.01%）

Elk: a tiny JS engine for embedded systems
 
  
 
Elk is a tiny embeddable JavaScript engine that implements a small but usable subset of ES6. It is designed for microcontroller development. Instead of writing firmware code in C/C++, Elk allows to develop in JavaScript. Another use case is providing customers with a secure, protected scripting environment for product customisation.
 
Elk features include:
 
 
 
Cross platform. Works anywhere from 8-bit microcontrollers to 64-bit servers
 
 
Zero dependencies. Builds cleanly by ISO C or ISO C++ compilers
 
 
Easy to embed: just copy elk.c and elk.h to your source tree
 
 
Very small and simple embedding API
 
 
Can call native C/C++ functions from JavaScript and vice versa

Toybox: all-in-one Linux command line.
 
--- Getting started
 
You can download static binaries for various targets from:
 
http://landley.net/toybox/bin
 
The special name "." indicates the current directory (just like ".." means the parent directory), and you can run a program that isn't in the $PATH by specifying a path to it, so this should work:
 
wget http://landley.net/toybox/bin/toybox-x86_64 chmod +x toybox-x86_64 ./toybox-x86_64 echo hello world
 
--- Building toybox
 
Type "make help" for build instructions.
 
Toybox uses the "make menuconfig; make; make install" idiom same as the Linux kernel. Usually you want something like:
 
make defconfig make make install
 
Or maybe:
 
LDFLAGS="--static" CROSS_COMPILE=armv5l- make defconfig toybox PREFIX=/path/to/root/filesystem/bi…]]></summary>

Reverse interview
 
This is a list of questions which may be interesting to a tech job applicant. The points are not ordered and many may not apply to a given position, or work type. It was started as my personal list of questions, which grew over time to include both things I'd like to see more of and red flags which I'd like to avoid. I've also noticed how few questions were asked by people I interviewed and I think those were missed opportunities.

《Go入门指南》
 
在接触 Go 语言之后，对这门编程语言非常着迷，期间也陆陆续续开始一些帮助国内编程爱好者了解和发展 Go 语言的工作，比如开始录制视频教程《Go编程基础》。但由于目前国内并没有比较好的 Go 语言书籍，而国外的优秀书籍因为英文的缘故在一定程度上也为不少 Go 语言爱好者带来了一些学习上的困扰，不仅为了加快扩散 Go 爱好者的国内群体，本人在完成阅读这本名叫 《The Way to Go》 之后，决定每天抽出一点时间来进行翻译的工作，并且以开源的形式免费分享给有需要的 Go 语言爱好者。
 
尽管该书对目前 Go 语言版本来说有小部分内容相对过时，但是为当下不可多得的好书，相关内容已获得作者同意根据当前 Go 语言版本进行修改而不作出特别声明。
 
该翻译版本已获得原作者（Ivo Balbaert）本人授权，并表示支持开源事业的发展！

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Stream video from ffmpeg to web(rtc)

ffmpeg-to-webrtc
 
ffmpeg-to-webrtc demonstrates how to send video from ffmpeg to your browser using pion.
 
This example has the same structure as play-from-disk-h264 but instead of reading from a file it reads H264 stream from ffmpeg stdout pipe.
 
Instructions
 
Open example page
 
jsfiddle.net you should see two text-areas and a 'Start Session' button
 
Copy browser's SessionDescription
 
In the jsfiddle the top textarea is your browser's SDP, copy that and:
 
Windows
 
 
 
Paste the SessionDescription into a file SDP.
 
 
Make sure ffmpeg in your PATH.
 
 
Run go run . <ffmpeg command line options> - < SDP
 
 
Note dash after ffmpeg options. It makes ffmpeg to write output to stdout. The app will read h264 stream from ffmpeg stdout.
 
 
ffmpeg output format should be h264. Browsers don't support all h264 profiles so it may not always work. Here is an example of format that works: -pix_fmt yuv420p -c:v libx264 -bsf:v h264_mp4toannexb -b:v 2M -max_delay 0 -bf 0 -f h264.
 
 
Input SessionDescription from ffmpeg-to-webrtc into your browser
 
When you see SDP in base64 format printed it means that SDP is already in copy buffer. So you can go to jsfiddle page and paste that into second text area
 
Hit 'Start Session' in jsfiddle
 
A video should start playing in your browser below the input boxes.
 
Examples (windows)
 
Share camera stream
 
go run . -rtbufsize 100M -f dshow -i video="PUT_DEVICE_NAME" -pix_fmt yuv420p -c:v libx264 -bsf:v h264_mp4toannexb -b:v 2M -max_delay 0 -bf 0 -f h264 - < SDP. There is a delay of several seconds. Should be possible to fix it with better ffmpeg configuration.
 
To check list of devices: ffmpeg -list_devices true -f dshow -i dummy.
 It is possible also to set a resolution and a format, for example -pixel_format yuyv422 -s 640x480. Possible formats: ffmpeg -list_options true -f dshow -i video=PUT_DEVICE_NAME.
 
Share screen or window

Folly (acronymed loosely after Facebook Open Source Library) is a library of C++14 components designed with practicality and efficiency in mind. Folly contains a variety of core library components used extensively at Facebook. In particular, it's often a dependency of Facebook's other open source C++ efforts and place where those projects can share code.
 
It complements (as opposed to competing against) offerings such as Boost and of course std. In fact, we embark on defining our own component only when something we need is either not available, or does not meet the needed performance profile. We endeavor to remove things from folly if or when std or Boost obsoletes them.

D3 combines powerful visualization and interaction techniques with a data-driven approach to DOM manipulation, giving you the full capabilities of modern browsers and the freedom to design the right visual interface for your data.

Installing
 
If you use npm, npm install d3. You can also download the latest release on GitHub. For vanilla HTML in modern browsers, import D3 from Skypack:
 
<script type="module">

import * as d3 from "https://cdn.skypack.dev/d3@7";

const div = d3.selectAll("div");

</script>

 
For legacy environments, you can load D3’s UMD bundle from an npm-based CDN such as jsDelivr; a d3 global is exported:
 
<script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/d3@7"></script>
<script>

const div = d3.selectAll("div");

</script>

 
You can also use the standalone D3 microlibraries. For example, d3-selection:
 
<script type="module">

import {selectAll} from "https://cdn.skypack.dev/d3-selection@3";

const div = selectAll("div");

</script>

 
D3 is written using ES2015 modules. Create a custom bundle using Rollup, Webpack, or your preferred bundler. To import D3 into an ES2015 application, either import specific symbols from specific D3 modules:
 
import {scaleLinear} from "d3-scale";

 
Or import everything into a namespace (here, d3):
 
import * as d3 from "d3";

 
Or using dynamic import:
 
const d3 = await import("d3");

 
You can also import individual modules and combine them into a d3 object using Object.assign:
 
const d3 = await Promise.all([
  import("d3-format"),
  import("d3-geo"),
  import("d3-geo-projection")
]).then(d3 => Object.assign({}, ...d3));]]></summary>

Introduction
 
原神自动钓鱼AI由YOLOX, DQN两部分模型组成。使用迁移学习，半监督学习进行训练。 模型也包含一些使用opencv等传统数字图像处理方法实现的不可学习部分。
 
其中YOLOX用于鱼的定位和类型的识别以及鱼竿落点的定位。DQN用于自适应控制钓鱼过程的点击，让力度落在最佳区域内。
 
安装使用流程
 
安装python运行环境（解释器），推荐使用 anaconda.
 
python环境配置
 
打开anaconda prompt(命令行界面)，创建新python环境并激活:
 
conda create -n ysfish python=3.6
conda activate ysfish

 
推荐安装python3.7或以下版本。
 
下载工程代码
 
使用git下载，git安装教程:
 
git clone https://github.com/7eu7d7/genshin_auto_fish.git

 
或直接在github网页端下载后直接解压。
 
依赖库安装
 
切换命令行到本工程所在目录:
 
cd genshin_auto_fish

 
执行以下命令安装依赖:
 
python -m pip install -U pip
python requirements.py

 
如果要使用显卡进行加速需要 安装CUDA和cudnn 安装后无视上面的命令用下面这条安装gpu版:
 
pip install -U pip
python requirements.py --cuda [cuda版本]
#例如安装的CUDA11.x
python requirements.py --cuda 110

 
可能会有Time out之类的报错，多试几遍，github太卡。
 
安装yolox
 
切换命令行到本工程所在目录，执行以下命令安装yolox:
 
python setup.py develop

 
预训练权重下载
 
下载预训练权重 (.pth文件),yolox_tiny.pth 下载后将权重文件放在 工程目录/weights 下
 
YOLOX训练工作流程
 
<只用来钓鱼不需要训练，直接用预训练权重就可以>
 
YOLOX部分因为打标签太累所以用半监督学习。标注少量样本后训练模型生成其余样本伪标签再人工修正，不断迭代提高精度。 样本量较少所以使用迁移学习，在COCO预训练的模型上进行fine-tuning.
 
下载数据集并解压：原神鱼群数据集, 数据集(迅雷云盘:ugha)
 
将yolox/exp/yolox_tiny_fish.py中的self.data_dir的值改为解压后2个文件夹所在的路径。
 
训练代码:
 
python yolox_tools/train.py -f yolox/exp/yolox_tiny_fish.py -d 1 -b 8 --fp16 -o -c weights/yolox_tiny.pth

 
DQN训练工作流程
 
控制力度使用强化学习模型DQN进行训练。两次进度的差值作为reward为模型提供学习方向。模型与环境间交互式学习。
 
直接在原神内训练耗时较长，太累了。首先制作一个仿真环境，大概模拟钓鱼力度控制操作。在仿真环境内预训练一个模型。 随后将这一模型迁移至原神内，实现域间迁移。
 
仿真环境预训练代码:
 
python train_sim.py

 
原神游戏内训练:
 
python train.py

 
运行钓鱼AI
 
命令行窗口一定要以管理员权限启动
 
显卡加速
 
python fishing.py image -f yolox/exp/yolox_tiny_fish.py -c weights/best_tiny3.pth --conf 0.25 --nms 0.45 --tsize 640 --device gpu

 
cpu运行
 
python fishing.py image -f yolox/exp/yolox_tiny_fish.py -c weights/best_tiny3.pth --conf 0.25 --nms 0.45 --tsize 640 --device cpu

 
运行后出现init ok后按r键开始钓鱼，原神需要全屏。出于性能考虑检测框不会实时显示，处理运算后台进行。]]></summary>

Propshaft
 
Propshaft is an asset pipeline library for Rails. It's built for an era where bundling assets to save on HTTP connections is no longer urgent, where JavaScript and CSS are either compiled by dedicated Node.js bundlers or served directly to the browsers, and where increases in bandwidth have made the need for minification less pressing. These factors allow for a dramatically simpler and faster asset pipeline compared to previous options, like Sprockets.
 
So that's what Propshaft doesn't do. Here's what it does provide:
 
 
 
Configurable load path: You can register directories from multiple places in your app and gems, and reference assets from all of these paths as though they were one.

 Skyline is an experimental emulator that runs on ARMv8 Android™ devices and emulates the functionality of a Nintendo Switch™ system, licensed under Mozilla Public License 2.0 
 
 
Contact
 
You can contact the core developers of Skyline at our Discord. If you have any questions, feel free to ask. It's also a good place to just keep up with the emulator, as most talk regarding development goes on over there.
 
 
Special Thanks
 
A few noteworthy teams/projects who've helped us along the way are:
 
 
 
 Ryujinx: We've used Ryujinx for reference throughout the project, the amount of accuracy of their HLE kernel implementation is what makes them such an amazing reference. The team behind the project has been really helpful with any queries we've had. It should be noted that Skyline is not based on Ryujinx.
  
 
 Switchbrew: We've extensively used Switchbrew whether that be their wiki with it's colossal amount of information on the Switch that has saved us countless hours of time or libnx which was crucial to initial development of the emulator to ensure that our HLE kernel and sysmodule implementations were accurate.
  
 
 Atmosphère: We've used libmesosphere as another reference for our HLE kernel, it's faithfulness to the HOS kernel helps us a lot. This makes it invaluably important for us as a tool for writing code that can accurately emulate HOS behavior without missing any crucial parts.

borb is a library for creating and manipulating PDF files in python.
 
0. About borb
 
borb is a pure python library to read, write and manipulate PDF documents. It represents a PDF document as a JSON-like datastructure of nested lists, dictionaries and primitives (numbers, string, booleans, etc)
 
This is currently a one-man project, so the focus will always be to support those use-cases that are more common in favor of those that are rare.
 
1. About the Examples
 
The examples can be found in a separate repository. This ensures the borb repository stays relatively small, whilst still providing a thorough knowledgebase of code-samples, screenshots and explanatory text.

kkndme_tianya（持续更新中...）
 
 
 
天涯神贴「2010年的房地产调控，我们收获了什么？写在房价暴涨前」脱水版，内容时间顺序和原贴一致，原贴中的优质非楼主写的内容，添加了引用格式便于区分。
 
 
除标题外，所有内容均来自原贴，标题是我简单加的，目的是为了做目录，便于查看。
 
 
kkndme神贴的内容还没有整理完，待全部整理完：
 
 
 
  
对kkndme的思想有了完整的认识后，我应该会在公众号沈正方上写写我对这个帖子内容的思考。
 
  
其次，我会把本仓库的内容做成PDF，通过公众号沈正方发出去，欢迎关注一起讨论！
 
 
 
 
 
 
希望调控可以降房价，希望终有一天房价下跌是人们的一厢情愿 
  
 
   
1、人人都有居住权。房子是用来住的，不是用来炒的。
 
   
2、房子太贵了，租售比严重不合理，空置率太高，人均收入太低，早晚要崩盘。
 
   
3、房价上涨造成物价上涨，人民生活变得困难
 
  
  
 
房地产调控的真正目的：防范金融风险 & 通过垄断实现gj利益最大化
 
 
官方公布的统计数据，只要关系到某个群体的利益，就一定会被修饰导致失真
 
 
税收从来都是向下游转嫁的 & 房产税迟迟不出台的真正原因
 
 
房地产的现状
 
 
房价持续上涨的本质是稀缺性让好房子成为资金最好的去处
 
 
关于垄断 
  
 
   
1、垄断的好处是没有风险
 
   
2、垄断可以解决社会稳定
 
   
3、房屋垄断只会愈演愈烈，底层人民想要拥有一套房子的难度只会越来越难
 
  
  
 
为什么政府没有那么在意民生问题？
 
 
房产税的制定原则
 
 
维稳的本质是人民能吃饱饭
 
 
公租房是为体制内服务的
 
 
房产税一定会转嫁给租房人

Official repository for the paper Robust High-Resolution Video Matting with Temporal Guidance. RVM is specifically designed for robust human video matting. Unlike existing neural models that process frames as independent images, RVM uses a recurrent neural network to process videos with temporal memory. RVM can perform matting in real-time on any videos without additional inputs. It achieves 4K 76FPS and HD 104FPS on an Nvidia GTX 1080 Ti GPU. The project was developed at ByteDance Inc.

Background
 
Although many PoC are already around the internet, I guessed to give myself a run to weaponizing this vulnerability, as what I found available lacked valuable information that it's worth sharing, also considering Microsoft already released a patch for this vulnerability.
 
So far, the only valuable resources I've seen to create a fully working generator are:

description: An open knowledge-sharing project .
 
The Machine & Deep Learning Compendium
 
Hi! Nearly a year ago I announced the Machine & Deep Learning Compendium, a Google document that I have been writing for the last 4 years. The ML Compendium contains over 500-topics, and it is over 400 pages long.
 
The Compendium is fully open. It is now a project on GitBook & GitHub (please star it!). I believe in knowledge sharing and the compendium will always be free to everyone.
 
I see this compendium as a gateway, as a frequently visited resource for people of various proficiency levels, for industry data scientists, and academics. The compendium will save you countless hours googling and sifting through articles that may not give you any value.
 
The Compendium includes around 500 topics, that contains various summaries, links, and articles that I have read on numerous topics that I found interesting or that I had needed to learn. It include the majority of modern machine learning algorithms, statistics, feature selection, and engineering techniques, deep-learning, NLP, audio, deep & classic vision, time-series, anomaly detection, graphs, experiment management, and much more. In addition to strategic topics such as data science management and team building, and essential topics such as product management, product design, and a technology stack from a DS POV.
 
Please keep in mind that this is a perpetual work in progress with a variety of topics. If you feel that something should be changed, you can now easily contribute using GitBook, GitHub, or contact me.
 
I would like to thank the following contributors: Samuel Jefroykin, Sefi Keller
 
Many Thanks,

  NOTE: This is prerelease software. As we work towards our first release, we will 💯 introduce breaking changes.  
 
  
Faust.js
  

 
       
 
    
        
 
Introduction
 
Faust.js is a framework for building front-end applications for headless WordPress sites. Faust.js provides tooling to reduce the pains of building a headless WordPress site (namely around data fetching, authentication, previews, and SSR/SSG) while offering a pleasant experience for both developers and publishers.
 
Getting Started
 
Faust.js aims to be framework agnostic, so it can be used with any front-end framework. Visit one of the guides below for a starting point:
 
 
 
Getting started with Next.js
 
 
As we work towards our first release, we will be introducing support for other frameworks.
 
Documentation
 
Visit https://faustjs.org/docs/next/getting-started to view the full documentation.
 
WordPress Plugin
 
There are two key parts to Faust.js: the NPM packages and the WordPress plugin. To take full advantage of headless, you will need to install the plugin in addition to the npm packages.
 
📥 Download Latest Version
 
After downloading the zip linked above, we recommend installing by manually uploading via the WordPress admin
 
Community
 
To chat with other Faust.js users and the headless community as a whole, you can join the WP Engine Developers Discord.
 
Additionally, if you have questions or ideas, please share them on GitHub Discussions.

图解 React 源码系列
 
 
 
react源码, 基于react@17.0.2(尽可能跟随 react 版本的升级, 持续更新). 用大量配图的方式, 致力于将react原理表述清楚.
 
 
使用指南
 
 
 
本系列以 react 核心包结构和运行机制为主线索进行展开. 包括react 宏观结构, react 工作循环, react 启动模式, react fiber原理, react hook原理, react 合成事件等核心内容.
 
 
开源作品需要社区的净化和参与, 如有表述不清晰或表述错误, 欢迎issue 勘误. 如果对你有帮助, 请不吝 star.
 
 
本系列最初写作于 2020 年 6 月(当时稳定版本是 v16.13.1), 随着 react 官方的升级, 本 repo 会将主要版本的文章保存在以版本号命名的分支中.
 
 
当下前端技术圈总体比较浮躁, 各技术平台充斥着不少"标题党". 真正对于技术本身, 不能急于求成, 需要静下心来修炼.
 
 
本系列不是面经, 但会列举一些面试题来加深对 react 理解.
 
 
本系列所有内容皆为原创, 如需转载, 请注明出处.
 
 
适用读者
 
 
 
对react,react-dom开发 web 应用有实践经验.
 
 
期望深入理解react内在作用原理.
 
 
 
版本跟踪
 
 
 
本系列暂时只跟踪稳定版本的变动. react仓库代码改动比较频繁, 在写作过程中, 如果伴随小版本的发布, 文章中的源码链接会以写作当天的最新小版本为基准.
 
 
 
 
 react@17.0.0作为主版本升级, 相较于 16.x 版本, 在使用层面基本维持不变, 在源码层面需要关注的重大的变动如下
 
  
 
    
    
 
     重大变动 
     所属板块 
     官方解释 
    
 
    
    
    
 
     重构Fiber.expirationTime并引入Fiber.lanes 
     react-reconciler 
     Initial Lanes implementation #18796 
    
 
    
 
     事件代理节点从 document 变成 rootNode, 取消合成事件的缓存池等 
     legacy-events(被移除), react-dom/events 
     changes-to-event-delegation 
    
 
    
  
  
 
 react@17.0.1相较于主版本v17.0.0做了一个点的优化, 改动了 1 个文件, 修复 ie11 兼容问题, 同时提升 v8 内部的执行性能.
  
 
 
 
react@17.0.2相较于v17.0.1, 改动集中于Scheduler包, 主杆逻辑没有变动, 只与调度性能统计相关.

Crossplane is an open source Kubernetes add-on that enables platform teams to assemble infrastructure from multiple vendors, and expose higher level self-service APIs for application teams to consume. Crossplane effectively enables platform teams to quickly put together their own opinionated platform declaratively without having to write any code, and offer it to their application teams as a self-service Kubernetes-style declarative API.
 
Both the higher level abstractions as well as the granular resources they are composed of are represented simply as objects in the Kubernetes API, meaning they can all be provisioned and managed by kubectl, GitOps, or any tools that can talk with the Kubernetes API. To …]]></summary>

Project Status
 
⚠️ Astro is still an early beta, missing features and bugs are to be expected! If you can stomach it, then Astro-built sites are production ready and several production websites built with Astro already exist in the wild. We will update this note once we get closer to a stable, v1.0 release.
 
Quick Start
 
# get started with astro in 3 easy steps:
mkdir new-project-directory
cd new-project-directory
npm init astro
