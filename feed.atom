Roadmap to becoming an Artificial Intelligence Expert in 2021
 
      
 
 

 
Below you find a set of charts demonstrating the paths that you can take and the technologies that you would want to adopt in order to become a data scientist, machine learning or an ai expert. We made these charts for our new employees to make them AI Experts but we wanted to share them here to help the community.
 
If you are interested to become an AI EXPERT at AMAI in Germany, or you want to hire an AI Expert, please say hi@am.ai.
 
Note
 
👉 An interactive version with links to follow about each bullet of the list can be found at i.am.ai/roadmap 👈
 
To receive updates star ⭐ and watch 👀 the GitHub Repo to get notified, when we add new content to stay on the top of the most recent research.
 
Disclaimer
 
The purpose of these roadmaps is to give you an idea about the landscape and to guide you if you are confused about what to learn next and not to encourage you to pick what is hip and trendy. You should grow some understanding of why one tool would better suited for some cases than the other and remember hip and trendy never means best suited for the job.

Project Status
 
⚠️ Astro is still an early beta, missing features and bugs are to be expected! If you can stomach it, then Astro-built sites are production ready and several production websites built with Astro already exist in the wild. We will update this note once we get closer to a stable, v1.0 release.
 
Quick Start
 
# get started with astro in 3 easy steps:
mkdir new-project-directory
cd new-project-directory
npm init astro
