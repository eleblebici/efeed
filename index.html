With a pleasant surprise, Chatwoot became a trending project on Hacker News and best of all, got lots of love from the community.

Front-end - Guideline

&quot;Every line of code should appear to be written by a single person, no matter the number of contributors.&quot; - Chinese Proverb.
 
 
The following document describes generic rules of writing in development languages that we use on our Front-end projects, that HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React, and Vue
 
The idea of this repository is not to be a complete guideline, the target is just to help developers who participate in our projects to be able to inform the coding standards used.
 
As this is a live document, some rules may not have been applied in old projects and changes can occur at any time.

                    <span>Deliver assets for Rails

Propshaft
 
Propshaft is an asset pipeline library for Rails. It&#x27;s built for an era where bundling assets to save on HTTP connections is no longer urgent, where JavaScript and CSS are either compiled by dedicated Node.js bundlers or served directly to the browsers, and where increases in bandwidth have made the need for minification less pressing. These factors allow for a dramatically simpler and faster asset pipeline compared to previous options, like Sprockets.
 
So that&#x27;s what Propshaft doesn&#x27;t do. Here&#x27;s what it does provide:
 
 
 
Configurable load path: You can register directories from multiple places in your app and gems, and reference assets from all of these paths as though they were one.
 
 
Digest stamping: All assets in the load path will be copied (…</span>

What the f*ck JavaScript?
 
   
 
 
 
A list of funny and tricky JavaScript examples
 
 
JavaScript is a great language. It has a simple syntax, large ecosystem and, what is most important, a great community.
 
At the same time, we all know that JavaScript is quite a funny language with tricky parts. Some of them can quickly turn our everyday job into hell, and some of them can make us laugh out loud.
 
The original idea for WTFJS belongs to Brian Leroux. This list is highly inspired by his talk “WTFJS” at dotJS 2012:

Kornia is a differentiable computer vision library for PyTorch.
 
It consists of a set of routines and differentiable modules to solve generic computer vision problems. At its core, the package uses PyTorch as its main backend both for efficiency and to take advantage of the reverse-mode auto-differentiation to define and compute the gradient of complex functions.

whatsapp-web.js
 
A WhatsApp API client that connects through the WhatsApp Web browser app
 
It uses Puppeteer to run a real instance of Whatsapp Web to avoid getting blocked.
 
NOTE: I can&#x27;t guarantee you will not be blocked by using this method, although it has worked for me. WhatsApp does not allow bots or unofficial clients on their platform, so this shouldn&#x27;t be considered totally safe.
 
Installation
 
The module is now available on npm! npm i whatsapp-web.js
 
Please note that Node v12+ is required.
 
Example usage
 
const { Client } &#x3D; require(&#x27;whatsapp-web.js&#x27;);

const client &#x3D; new Client();

This repository contains the course source code and other extra materials like slides.
 
How to use
 
The code snapshots are organized in multiple branches where every branch represents a course section.
 
For example, the branch 01-getting-started holds all code snapshots and extra materials for section 1 of the course (&quot;Getting Started&quot;).
 
You can switch branches via the branch dropdown above the directory explorer.
 

 
In most branches, you&#x27;ll find multiple folders which organize the section-specific content further:
 
 
 
Often, you&#x27;ll find a /code subfolder which contains any relevent code snapshots for the given course section

Contact
 
You can contact the core developers of Skyline at our Discord. If you have any questions, feel free to ask. It&#x27;s also a good place to just keep up with the emulator, as most talk regarding development goes on over there.
 
 
Special Thanks
 
A few noteworthy teams/projects who&#x27;ve helped us along the way are:
 
 
 
 Ryujinx: We&#x27;ve used Ryujinx for reference throughout the project, the amount of accuracy of their HLE kernel implementation is what makes them such an amazing reference. The team behind the project has been really helpful with any queries we&#x27;ve had. It should be noted that Skyline is not based on Ryujinx.
  
 
 Switchbrew: We&#x27;ve extensively used Switchbrew whether that be their wiki with it&#x27;s colossal amount of information on the Switch that has saved us countless hours of time or libnx which was crucial to initial development of the emulator to ensure that our HLE kernel and sysmodule implementations were accurate.
  
 
 Atmosphère: We&#x27;ve used libmesosphere as another reference for our HLE kernel, it&#x27;s faithfulness to the HOS kernel helps us a lot. This makes it invaluably important for us as a tool for writing code that can accurately emulate HOS behavior without missing any crucial parts.

borb is a library for creating and manipulating PDF files in python.
 
0. About borb
 
borb is a pure python library to read, write and manipulate PDF documents. It represents a PDF document as a JSON-like datastructure of nested lists, dictionaries and primitives (numbers, string, booleans, etc)
 
This is currently a one-man project, so the focus will always be to support those use-cases that are more common in favor of those that are rare.
 
1. About the Examples
 
The examples can be found in a separate repository. This ensures the borb repository stays relatively small, whilst still providing a thorough knowledgebase of code-samples, screenshots and explanatory text.

Python Programming Puzzles (P3)
 
This repo contains a dataset of Python programming puzzles which can be used to teach and evaluate an AI&#x27;s programming proficiency. We hope this dataset will grow rapidly, and it is already diverse in terms of problem difficulty, domain, and algorithmic tools needed to solve the problems. Please propose a new puzzle or browse newly proposed puzzles or contribute through pull requests.

Why did you make Iris?
 
Iris was created to fill a void that I saw in the Minecraft customization and graphical enhancement community: the lack of an open-source shaders mod that would let me load my favorite shader packs on modern versions of the game, while retaining performance and compatibility with modpacks. OptiFine, the current dominant mod for loading shader packs, has restrictive…</span>

                    <span>Collect information of Windows PC when doing incident response

 
 
🔳 DFIRT (DFIR Tool)
 
Collect information of Windows PC when doing incident response.
 
 
ℹ DFIRT is a Powershell script. It collects information of- 
 
 
 
recently used files,
 
 
suspicious Event ID,
 
 
Powershell history for all session,
 
 
files opened directly from Windows Explorer,
 
 
network related running services,
 
 
free space of disk,
 
 
Internet connectivity information,
 
 
safe DLL search mode,
 
 
last boot up time,
 
 
user accounts list from SID,
 
 
computer name, current build, ID,
 
 
current user language settings,
 
 
Windows Defender Status,
 
 
current Admin Approval Mode policy,
 
 
domain,
 
 
non default folders in Program File.
 
 
 
🔰 How to use:
 1. Download the dfirt.ps1 script.
 2. Start Windows Powershell.
 3. Go to the DFIR folder.
 4. Write 
.\dfirt.ps1 and press Enter.
 5. Now, DFIRT will start collecting information and save those information in report.txt file. 
 
⚠ Remember
 When you will run the script, result will be saved in report.txt file. But, if you again run the script and there is still previously saved report.txt file in the DFIRT folder then, the file will be overwritten with new report. 
 
💬 A message to you:
 I will try to continuously add new features to DFIRT. If you wish to add functionality, feel free to contribute here.</span>

A Raspberry Pi Configuration for Internet connectivity
 
I have had a couple Pis doing random Internet-related duties for years. It&#x27;s finally time to formalize their configs and make all the DNS/ad-blocking/monitoring stuff encapsulated into one Ansible project.
 
So that&#x27;s what this is.
 
Features
 
Internet Monitoring: Installs Prometheus and Grafana, along with a few Docker containers to monitor your Internet connection with Speedtest.net speedtests and HTTP tests so you can see uptime, ping stats, and speedtest results over time.

kkndme_tianya（持续更新中...）
 
 
 
天涯神贴「2010年的房地产调控，我们收获了什么？写在房价暴涨前」脱水版，内容时间顺序和原贴一致，原贴中的优质非楼主写的内容，添加了引用格式便于区分。
 
 
除标题外，所有内容均来自原贴，标题是我简单加的，目的是为了做目录，便于查看。
 
 
kkndme神贴的内容还没有整理完，待全部整理完：
 
 
 
  
对kkndme的思想有了完整的认识后，我应该会在公众号沈正方上写写我对这个帖子内容的思考。
 
  
其次，我会把本仓库的内容做成PDF，通过公众号沈正方发出去，欢迎关注一起讨论！
 
 
 
 
 
 
希望调控可以降房价，希望终有一天房价下跌是人们的一厢情愿 
  
 
   
1、人人都有居住权。房子是用来住的，不是用来炒的。
 
   
2、房子太贵了，租售比严重不合理，空置率太高，人均收入太低，早晚要崩盘。
 
   
3、房价上涨造成物价上涨，人民生活变得困难
 
  
  
 
房地产调控的真正目的：防范金融风险 &amp; 通过垄断实现gj利益最大化
 
 
官方公布的统计数据，只要关系到某个群体的利益，就一定会被修饰导致失真
 
 
税收从来都是向下游转嫁的 &amp; 房产税迟迟不出台的真正原因
 
 
房地产的现状
 
 
房价持续上涨的本质是稀缺性让好房子成为资金最好的去处
 
 
关于垄断

Robust Video Matting (RVM)
 

 
English | 中文
 
Official repository for the paper Robust High-Resolution Video Matting with Temporal Guidance. RVM is specifically designed for robust human video matting. Unlike existing neural models that process frames as independent images, RVM uses a recurrent neural network to process videos with temporal memory. RVM can perform matting in real-time on any videos without additional inputs. It achieves 4K 76FPS and HD 104FPS on an Nvidia GTX 1080 Ti GPU. The project was developed at ByteDance Inc.

Physics-Based Deep Learning
 
The following collection of materials targets &quot;Physics-Based Deep Learning&quot; (PBDL), i.e., the field of methods with combinations of physical modeling and deep learning (DL) techniques. Here, DL will typically refer to methods based on artificial neural networks. The general direction of PBDL represents a very active and quickly growing field of research.
 
If you&#x27;re interested in a comprehensive overview, please check our digital PBDL book: https://www.physicsbaseddeeplearning.org/ (or as PDF: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2109.05237.pdf)

Fully Weaponized CVE-2021-40444
 
Malicious docx generator to exploit CVE-2021-40444 (Microsoft Office Word Remote Code Execution), works with arbitrary DLL files.
 
Background
 
Although many PoC are already around the internet, I guessed to give myself a run to weaponizing this vulnerability, as what I found available lacked valuable information that it&#x27;s worth sharing, also considering Microsoft already released a patch for this vulnerability.
 
So far, the only valuable resources I&#x27;ve seen to create a fully working generator are:

The Machine &amp; Deep Learning Compendium
 
Hi! Nearly a year ago I announced the Machine &amp; Deep Learning Compendium, a Google document that I have been writing for the last 4 years. The ML Compendium contains over 500-topics, and it is over 400 pages long.
 
The Compendium is fully open. It is now a project on GitBook &amp; GitHub (please star it!). I believe in knowledge sharing and the compendium will always be free to everyone.
 
I see this compendium as a gateway, as a frequently visited resource for people of various proficiency levels, for industry data scientists, and academics. The compendium will save you countless hours googling and sifting through articles that may not give you any value.
 
The Compendium includes around 500 topics, that contains various summaries, links, and articles that I have read on numerous topics that I found interesting or that I had needed to learn. It include the majority of modern machine learning algorithms, statistics, feature selection, and engineering techniques, deep-learning, NLP, audio, deep &amp; classic vision, time-series, anomaly detection, graphs, experiment management, and much more. In addition to strategic topics such as data science management and team building, and essential topics such as product management, product design, and a technology stack from a DS POV.
 
Please keep in mind that this is a perpetual work in progress with a variety of topics. If you feel that something should be changed, you can now easily contribute using GitBook, GitHub, or contact me.
 
I would like to thank the following contributors: Samuel Jefroykin, Sefi Keller

                    <span>Faust.js - The Headless WordPress Framework

  NOTE: This is prerelease software. As we work towards our first release, we will 💯 introduce breaking changes.  
 
  
Faust.js
  

 
       
 
    
        
 
Introduction
 
Faust.js is a framework for building front-end applications for headless WordPress sites. Faust.js provides tooling to reduce the pains of building a headless WordPress site (namely around data fetching, authentication, previews, and SSR/SSG) while offering a pleasant experience for both developers and publishers.
 
Getting Started
 
Faust.js aims to be framework agnostic, so it can be used with any front-end framework. Visit one of the guides below for a starting point:
 
 
 
Getting started with Next.js
 
 
As we work towards our first release, we will be introducing support for other frameworks.
 
Documentation
 
Visit https://faustjs.org/docs/next/getting-started to view the full documentation.
 
WordPress Plugin
 
There are two key parts to Faust.js: the NPM packages and the WordPress plugin. To take full advantage of headless, you will need to install the plugin in addition to the npm packages.
 
📥 Download Latest Version
 
After downloading the zip linked above, we recommend installing by manually uploading via the WordPress admin
 
Community
 
To chat with other Faust.js users and the headless community as a whole, you can join the WP Engine Developers Discord.
 
Additionally, if you have questions or ideas, please share them on GitHub Discussions.

Authelia is an open-source authentication and authorization server providing two-factor authentication and single sign-on (SSO) for your applications via a web portal. It acts as a companion for reverse proxies like nginx, Traefik or HAProxy to let them know whether requests should either be allowed or redirected to Authelia&#x27;s portal for authentication.
 
Documentation is available at https://www.authelia.com/docs.
 
The following is a simple diagram of the architecture:
 
  
 
Authelia can be installed as a standalone service from the AUR, APT, FreeBSD Ports, or using a Static binary, .deb package, Docker or Kubernetes either manually or via the Helm Chart (beta) leveraging ingress controllers and ingress configuratio…</span>

Sogou C++ Workflow
 
   
 
As Sogou&#x60;s C++ server engine, Sogou C++ Workflow supports almost all back-end C++ online services of Sogou, including all search services, cloud input method，online advertisements, etc., handling more than 10 billion requests every day. This is an enterprise-level programming engine in light and elegant design which can satisfy most C++ back-end development requirements.
 
You can use it:
 
 
 
To quickly build an HTTP server:
 
 
#include 
#include &quot;workflow/WFHttpServer.h&quot;

int main()
{
    WFHttpServer server([](WFHttpTask *task) {

                    <span>图解react源码, 用大量配图的方式, 致力于将react原理表述清楚.

图解 React 源码系列
 
 
 
react源码, 基于react@17.0.2(尽可能跟随 react 版本的升级, 持续更新). 用大量配图的方式, 致力于将react原理表述清楚.
 
 
使用指南
 
 
 
本系列以 react 核心包结构和运行机制为主线索进行展开. 包括react 宏观结构, react 工作循环, react 启动模式, react fiber原理, react hook原理, react 合成事件等核心内容.
 
 
开源作品需要社区的净化和参与, 如有表述不清晰或表述错误, 欢迎issue 勘误. 如果对你有帮助, 请不吝 star.
 
 
本系列最初写作于 2020 年 6 月(当时稳定版本是 v16.13.1), 随着 react 官方的升级, 本 repo 会将主要版本的文章保存在以版本号命名的分支中.
 
 
当下前端技术圈总体比较浮躁, 各技术平台充斥着不少&quot;标题党&quot;. 真正对于技术本身, 不能急于求成, 需要静下心来修炼.
 
 
本系列不是面经, 但会列举一些面试题来加深对 react 理解.
 
 
本系列所有内容皆为原创, 如需转载, 请注明出处.
 
 
适用读者
 
 
 
对react,react-dom开发 web 应用有实践经验.
 
 
期望深入理解react内在作用原理.
 
 
 
版本跟踪
 
 
 
本系列暂时只跟踪稳定版本的变动. react仓库代码改动比较频繁, 在写作过程中, 如果伴随小版本的发布, 文章中的源码链接会以写作当天的最新小版本为基准.
 
 
 
 
 react@17.0.0作为主版本升级, 相较于 16.x 版本, 在使用层面基本维持不变, 在源码层面需要关注的重大的变动如下
 
  
 
    
    
 
     重大变动 
     所属板块 
     官方解释 
    
 
    
    
    
 
     重构Fiber.expirationTime并引入Fiber.lanes 
     react-reconciler 
     Initial Lanes implementation #18796 
    
 
    
 
     事件代理节点从 document 变成 rootNode, 取消合成事件的缓存池等 
     legacy-events(被移除), react-dom/events 
     changes-to-event-delegation 
    
 
    
  
  
 
 react@17.0.1相较于主版本v17.0.0做了一个点的优化, 改动了 1 个文件, 修复 ie11 兼容问题, 同时提升 v8 内部的执行性能.
  
 
 
 
react@17.0.2相较于v17.0.1, 改动集中于Scheduler包, 主杆逻辑没有变动, 只与调度性能统计相关.

About The Project
 
 
Scheduling infrastructure for absolutely everyone.
 
The open source Calendly alternative. You are in charge of your own data, workflow and appearance.
 
Calendly and other scheduling tools are awesome. It made our lives massively easier. We&#x27;re using it for business meetings, seminars, yoga classes and even calls with our families. However, most tools are very limited in terms of control and customisations.
 
That&#x27;s where Cal.com comes in. Self-hosted or hosted by us. White-label by design. API-driven and ready to be deployed on your own domain. Full control of your events and data.…</span>

📚 Awesome cheatsheets for popular programming languages, frameworks and development tools. They include everything you should know in one single file.
 
 
🤔 Why Awesome-Cheatsheets?
 
I usually make a cheat sheet when I want to improve my skills in a programming language, a framework or a development tool. I started doing these kinds of things a long time ago on Gist. To better keep track of the history and to let people contribute, I reorganized all of them into this single repository. Most of the content is coming from official documentation and some books I have read.

Crossplane is an open source Kubernetes add-on that enables platform teams to assemble infrastructure from multiple vendors, and expose higher level self-service APIs for application teams to consume. Crossplane effectively enables platform teams to quickly put together their own opinionated platform declaratively without having to write any code, and offer it to their application teams as a self-service Kubernetes-style declarative API.
 
Both the higher level abstractions as well as the granular resources they are composed of are represented simply as objects in the Kubernetes API, meaning they can all be provisioned and managed by kubectl, GitOps, or any tools that can talk with the Kubernetes API. To …</span>

About
 
drawio-desktop is a diagrams.net desktop app based on Electron. draw.io is the old name for diagrams.net, we just don&#x27;t want the hassle of changing all the binary&#x27;s names.
 
Download built binaries from the releases section.
 
Security
 
draw.io Desktop is designed to be completely isolated from the Internet, apart from the update process. This checks github.com at startup for a newer version and downloads it from an AWS S3 bucket owned by Github. All JavaScript files are self-contained, the Content Security Policy forbids running remotely loaded JavaScript.
 
No diagram data is ever sent externally, nor do we send any analytics about app usage externally. This means certain functionality for which we do not have a JavaScript implementation …</span>

Coding Interview University
 
 
 
I originally created this as a short to-do list of study topics for becoming a software engineer, but it grew to the large list you see today. After going through this study plan, I got hired as a Software Development Engineer at Amazon! You probably won&#x27;t have to study as much as I did. Anyway, everything you need is here.
 
 
I studied about 8-12 hours a day, for several months. This is my story: Why I studied full-time for 8 months for a Google interview
 
 
Please Note: You won&#x27;t need to study as much as I did. I wasted a lot of time on things I didn&#x27;t need to know. More info about that below. I&#x27;ll help you get there without wasting your precious time.

Project Status
 
⚠️ Astro is still an early beta, missing features and bugs are to be expected! If you can stomach it, then Astro-built sites are production ready and several production websites built with Astro already exist in the wild. We will update this note once we get closer to a stable, v1.0 release.
 
Quick Start
