Roadmap to becoming an Artificial Intelligence Expert in 2021
 
      
 
 

 
Below you find a set of charts demonstrating the paths that you can take and the technologies that you would want to adopt in order to become a data scientist, machine learning or an ai expert. We made these charts for our new employees to make them AI Experts but we wanted to share them here to help the community.
 
If you are interested to become an AI EXPERT at AMAI in Germany, or you want to hire an AI Expert, please say hi@am.ai.
 
Note

Disclaimer
 
The purpose of these roadmaps is to give you an idea about the landscape and to guide you if you are confused about what to learn next and not to encourage you to pick what is hip and trendy. You should grow some understanding of why one tool would better suited for some cases than the other and remember hip and trendy never means best suited for the job.

                    <span>TensorFlow Similarity is a python package focused on making similarity learning quick and easy.

TensorFlow Similarity: Metric Learning for Humans
 
TensorFlow Similarity is a TensorFLow library for similarity learning also known as metric learning and contrastive learning.
 
TensorFlow Similarity is still in beta.
 
Introduction
 
Tensorflow Similarity offers state-of-the-art algorithms for metric learning and all the necessary components to research, train, evaluate, and serve similarity-based models.
 

 
With TensorFlow Similarity you can train and serve models that find similar items (such as images) in a large corpus of examples. For example, as visible above, you can train a similarity model to find and cluster similar looking images of cats and dogs from the Oxford IIIT Pet Dataset…</span>

About
 
drawio-desktop is a diagrams.net desktop app based on Electron. draw.io is the old name for diagrams.net, we just don&#x27;t want the hassle of changing all the binary&#x27;s names.
 
Download built binaries from the releases section.
 
Security
 
draw.io Desktop is designed to be completely isolated from the Internet, apart from the update process. This checks github.com at startup for a newer version and downloads it from an AWS S3 bucket owned by Github. All JavaScript files are self-contained, the Content Security Policy forbids running remotely loaded JavaScript.
 
No diagram data is ever sent externally, nor do we send any analytics about app usage externally. This means certain functionality for which we do not have a JavaScript implementation …</span>

Coding Interview University
 
 
 
I originally created this as a short to-do list of study topics for becoming a software engineer, but it grew to the large list you see today. After going through this study plan, I got hired as a Software Development Engineer at Amazon! You probably won&#x27;t have to study as much as I did. Anyway, everything you need is here.
 
 
I studied about 8-12 hours a day, for several months. This is my story: Why I studied full-time for 8 months for a Google interview
 
 
Please Note: You won&#x27;t need to study as much as I did. I wasted a lot of time on things I didn&#x27;t need to know. More info about that below. I&#x27;ll help you get there without wasting your precious time.

Project Status
 
⚠️ Astro is still an early beta, missing features and bugs are to be expected! If you can stomach it, then Astro-built sites are production ready and several production websites built with Astro already exist in the wild. We will update this note once we get closer to a stable, v1.0 release.
 
Quick Start
 
# get started with astro in 3 easy steps:
mkdir new-project-directory
cd new-project-directory
