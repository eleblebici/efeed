🦀 Why Rust?
 
 
 
With Rust, &quot;If it compiles, it works.&quot; and also, it compiles to many platforms.
 
 
Rust is fast, has no VM, or unnecessary cruft (typically 5-8mb binaries with LOTS of code and libraries).
 
 
Multi purpose, safe, and generalistic - makes for healthy and expressive mission critical code. Adding code or abstraction doesn&#x27;t increase bloat, doesn&#x27;t hurt p…</span>

MiRage Modular Keyboard

The MiRage is a 60% ortholinear keyboard with three clickable OLED displays, intended for Kailh Choc switches and running custom CircuitPython firmware on a Seeedstudio Xiao RP2040.
 
THIS PROJECT IS INCOMPLETE. DO NOT MAKE IT.
 
The PCB can be populated as-is for a &quot;plank&quot; keyboard or broken in half for a split board. The right half can be used independently as the Rage Pad numberpad/macro pad/stream deck.
 
This was designed for a YouTube video on my channel: https://youtu.be/Fg0V5M0llaE It will be improved and sold as a kit, and will form part of a larger project called the Fata Morgana cyberdeck.

Most Broadcom USB Bluetooth devices make use of a system called RAMUSB. RAMUSB allows the firmware for the device to be updated on-the-fly, however any updates previously applied are lost when shutting down the machine.
 
The Broadcom Windows driver will upload firmware into the Broadcom Bluetooth device on every startup, however for macOS this functionality is not supported out of the box. BrcmPatchRAM kext is a macOS driver which applies PatchRAM updates for Broadcom RAMUSB based devices. It will apply the firmware update to your Broadcom Bluetooth device on every startup / wakeup, identical to the Windows drivers. The firmware applied is extracted from the Windows drivers and the functionality should be equal to Windows.

                    <span>Software Dummy Display Adapter for Apple Silicon Macs to Have Custom HiDPI Resolutions.

BetterDummy
 
Dummy Display for Apple Silicon Macs to achieve custom resolutions.
 
About
 
M1 macs tend to have issues with custom resolutions. Notoriously they don&#x27;t allow sub 4K resolution displays to have HiDPI (&quot;Retina&quot;) resolutions even though for example a 24&quot; QHD display would greatly benefit from having an 1920x1080 HiDPI &quot;Retina&quot; mode.
 
To fix this issue, many resort to buying a 4K HDMI dummy dongle to fool macOS into thinking that a 4K display is connected and then mirror the contents of this dummy display to the physical display in order to have HiDPI resolution. Others use the built in screens of their MacBooks to mirror to the external display. These approaches have obvious drawbacks and…</span>

⭐️ Why
 
Building a notification system is hard, at first it seems like just sending an email but in reality it&#x27;s just the beginning. In today&#x27;s world users expect multi channel communication experience over email, sms, push, direct and more... An ever growing list of providers are popping up each day, and notifications are spread around the code. Notifire&#x27;s goal is to simplify notifications and provide developers the tools to create meaningful communication between the system and it&#x27;s users.

Introduction
 
Cherry Markdown Editor is a Javascript Markdown editor. It has the advantages such as out-of-the-box, lightweight and easy to extend. It can run in browser or server(with NodeJs).
 
Out-of-the-box
 
Developer can call and instantiate Cherry Markdown Editor in a very simple way. The instantiated Cherry Markdown Editor supports most commonly used markdown syntax (such as title, TOC, flowchart, formula, etc.) by default.
 
Easy to extend
 
When the syntax that Cherry Markdown editor support can not meet your needs, secondary development or function extention can be carried out quickly. At the same time, Cherry Markdown editor should be implemented by pure JavaScript, and should not rely on framework technology su…</span>

This repository contains the analysis performed on the leaked forged COVID-19 Certificates. The certificates, contained in string format in the samples/ directory, have been collected from the 4Chan and Raid Forums posts.
 
The results are in the RESULTS.md file and can be generated using ./verify.sh.
 
Please - stay safe and get vaccinated!
 
The situation
 
On 2021-10-27 @emanuelelaface created an issue on ehn-dcc-development/hcert-spec to report a possible private key leakage of French and Polish governments.
 
The issue reports that (online and on Telegram) some forged COVID-19 Certificates are circulating and are still marked as valid.
 
The two certificates mentioned in the post are associated with &quot;Adolf Hitler&quot; with two different dates of birth.

使用
 
PD Runner是一个菜单栏APP, 启动后会在菜单栏显示程序图标. 点击菜单栏图标可列出当前Mac上安装的所有客户机, 然后点击客户机名称即可启动对应的客户机.
 
常见问题
 
1. 什么首次启动会需要输入密码?
 
 
 
因为针对PD 17.1.0新引入的鉴权措施, 需要通过快速切换系统时间来绕过. 所以需要向系统中安装一个特权助理, 方便进行修改时间的操作. 如果不这样做, 那么每次启动虚拟机的时候就都需要输入一次密码.
 
 
2. 为什么PD Runner启动后没有任何窗口?
 
 
 
因为PD Runner是一款菜单栏APP, 启动后只会在菜单栏显示一个图标以供使用, 并没有主窗口.
 
 
3. 虚拟机需要修改为指定的名称才能使用吗?
 
 
 
不需要, PD Runner可以全自动识别当前系统中的客户机, 并自动列出. 不要用户干预.
 
 
4. 安装帮助程序时弹出错误提示怎么办?
 
 
 
如果您看到的错误代码为&quot;Domain&#x3D;CFError DomainLaunchd Code&#x3D;9&quot;, 请尝试在系统的&quot;终端&quot;APP中执行 sudo launchctl enable system/com.lihaoyun6.PD-Runner-Helper
 并输入密码, 然后再次启动PD Runner既可正常使用 (输入密码的过程是不显示密码的, 并不是没有输入进去, 正常输入并回车既可)</span>

Automated cryptocurrency trading bot
 
 
Why?
 
This project was inspired by the observation that all cryptocurrencies pretty much behave in the same way. When one spikes, they all spike, and when one takes a dive, they all do. Pretty much. Moreover, all coins follow Bitcoin&#x27;s lead; the difference is their phase offset.
 
So, if coins are basically oscillating with respect to each other, it seems smart to trade the rising coin for the falling coin, and then trade back when the ratio is reversed.
 
How?
 
The trading is done in the Binance market platform, which of course, does not have markets for every altcoin pair. The workaround for this is to use a bridge currency that will complement missing pairs. The default bridge cu…</span>

                    <span>A project that uses optical flow and machine learning to detect aimhacking in video clips.

waldo-anticheat
 
A project that aims to use optical flow and machine learning to visually detect cheating or hacking in video clips from fps games. Check out this video discussing the purpose and vision of WALDO.
 
Notes
 
 
 
This project is still under development.
 
 
The What
 
A new market for cheats that are visually indistinguishable to the human eye have lead to a rise in &quot;closet hacking&quot; among streamers and professionals. This form of cheating is extremely hard to detect. In some cases it is impossible to detect, even with today&#x27;s most advanced anti-cheat software.
 
We will combat this new kind of cheating by creating our own deep learning program to detect this behavior in video clips.
 
The How
 
Because of the advanced technology used, the only reliable way to detect this form of cheating is by observing the cheating behavior directly from the end result- gameplay. Our goal is to analyze the video directly using deep learning to detect if a user is receiving machine assistance.
 
Phase 1 focuses primarily on humanized aim-assist. Upon completion of phase 1, WALDO&#x27;s main function will be vindication and clarity to many recent &quot;hackusations.&quot;

allows any two computers to transfer data (using a relay)
 
 
provides end-to-end encryption (using PAKE)
 
 
enables easy cross-platform transfers (Windows, Linux, Mac)
 
 
allows multiple file transfers
 
 
allows resuming transfers that are interrupted
 
 
local server or port-forwarding not needed

                    <span>🍃 JavaScript library for mobile-friendly interactive maps
 
Leaflet is the leading open-source JavaScript library for mobile-friendly interactive maps. Weighing just about 39 KB of gzipped JS plus 4 KB of gzipped CSS code, it has all the mapping features most developers ever need.
 
Leaflet is designed with simplicity, performance and usability in mind. It works efficiently across all major desktop and mobile platforms out of the box, taking advantage of HTML5 and CSS3 on modern browsers while being accessible on older ones too. It can be extended with a huge amount of plugins, has a beautiful, easy to use and well-documented API and a simple, readable source code that is a joy to contribute to.
 
For more info, docs and tutorials, check out the official website.
 For Leaflet downloads (including the built master version), check out the download page.
 
We&#x27;re happy to meet new contributors. If you want to get involved with Leaflet development, check out the contribution guide. Let&#x27;s make the best mapping library that will ever exist, and push the limits of what&#x27;s possible with online maps!</span>

                    <span>My NixOS configurations.

NixOS System Configurations
 
This repository contains my NixOS system configurations. This repository isn&#x27;t meant to be a turnkey solution to copying my setup or learning Nix, so I want to apologize to anyone trying to look for something &quot;easy&quot;. I&#x27;ve tried to use very simple Nix practices wherever possible, but if you wish to copy from this, you&#x27;ll have to learn the basics of Nix, NixOS, etc.
 
I don&#x27;t claim to be an expert at Nix or NixOS, so there are certainly improvements that could be made! Feel free to suggest them, but please don&#x27;t be offended if I don&#x27;t integrate them, I value having my config work over having it be optimal.
 
How I Work
 
I like to use macOS as the host OS and NixOS within a VM as my primary development environment. I use the graphical a…</span>

翻墙软件VPN推荐，中国仅2款好用(2021年10月最新)
 
最近更新：2021年10月23日
 
 
 
目前在国内能长期稳定、好用的翻墙VPN很少了，包括不少VPN评论网站也是东抄抄西抄抄，很多过期的内容，部分推荐的在国内并不好用，注意查看下文提醒避免入坑。本文根据实际的使用体验介绍各款翻墙软件VPN近期使用情况，供大家参考和避坑。本文是中国安全翻墙攻略的详细版，讨论翻墙软件、科学上网和网络安全的相关问题，如果只想快速选个科学上网软件来翻墙，直接看下方本文目录导航。
 
 
翻墙（科学上网）重不重要？我想大家都知道，不然也不会看到这篇文章了，翻不了墙就不能Google找程序代码，不能回Gmail邮件，不翻墙就不能看YouTube视频，Udemy买的课程能不能看的舒服？HBO、Netflix能不能追剧？由于工作出差和生活学习需要我经常在国内不同地区翻墙上网，就自己的使用感受和对翻墙软件这个行业的了解，为读者推荐在国内最好用、稳定和安全的科学上网方法和工具，并长期关注VPN、SSR、WireGuard、V2Ray、蓝灯等翻墙和信息安全技术。
 

 
本文作者常年出差，由于生活和工作需要，也为了自己查找资料更加便利，我手机和PC上安装了一共7-8个付费翻墙APP作为常年的备用，担心出差途中不能翻墙和公共网络的安全性，所有我比较关注这类翻墙软件在不同网络环境下的连接稳定性和隐私数据的安全性。根据自己过去2年的测试和使用体验，对几种国内流行的翻墙软件和技术方法做出对比，读者可根据自己的实际情况选择合适的翻墙工具。

XcodeBenchmark contains a large codebase to measure the compilation time in Xcode.
 
You are probably familiar with the following question:
 
 
 
&quot;Should I buy an i5, i7, or even i9 processor for iOS/macOS development?&quot;.
 
 
XcodeBenchmark is initially created for Max Tech YouTube channel to compare the performance of new iMacs 2020.
 
I believe the results will help developers to make the right cost/performance trade-off decision when choosing their next Mac.

Introduction
 
Motivation
 
This document is a cheatsheet for PHP you will frequently encounter in modern projects and most contemporary sample code.
 
This guide is not intended to teach you PHP from the ground up, but to help developers with basic knowledge who may struggle to get familiar with modern codebases (or let&#x27;s say to learn Laravel or Symfony for instance) because of the new PHP concepts and features introduced over the years.
 
 
 
Note: Concepts introduced here are based on the most recent version of PHP available (PHP 8.0 at the time of the last update)

What is Svelte?
 
Svelte is a new way to build web applications. It&#x27;s a compiler that takes your declarative components and converts them into efficient JavaScript that surgically updates the DOM.
 
Learn more at the Svelte website, or stop by the Discord chatroom.
 
Supporting Svelte
 
Svelte is an MIT-licensed open source project with its ongoing development made possible entirely by fantastic volunteers. If you&#x27;d like to support their efforts, please consider:
 
 
 
Becoming a backer on Open Collective.
 
 
Funds donated via Open Collective will be used for compensating expenses related to Svelte&#x27;s development such as hosting costs. If sufficient donations are received, funds may also be used to support Svelte&#x27;s development more directly.

Fugu14 - Untethered iOS 14 Jailbreak
 
Fugu14 is an (incomplete) iOS 14 Jailbreak, including an untether (persistence), kernel exploit, kernel PAC bypass and PPL bypass. The CVE numbers of the vulnerabilities are: CVE-2021-30740, CVE-2021-30768, CVE-2021-30769, CVE-2021-30770 and CVE-2021-30773.
 
Supported Devices/iOS Versions
 
Fugu14 should support all arm64e devices (iPhone XS and newer) on iOS 14.3 - 14.5.1.
 Support for lower versions (down to 14.2) can be added by editing arm/shared/ClosurePwn/Sources/ClosurePwn/PwnClosure.swift and arm/shared/KernelExploit/Sources/KernelExploit/offsets.swift.
 
arm64 devices are not supported because the exploit to install the Fugu14 App does not work on these devices.

一个综合了豆瓣，goodreads综合评分的计算机书籍书单
 
介绍
 
整理了豆瓣和goodreads的和计算机，互联网有关的几乎所有书籍，根据不同版本，两个平台的总评价人数和评分求出平均分，按从高到低排列，希望能对寻找经典计算机书籍的朋友提供帮助，排序仅供参考，评分的高低不一定代表书籍的真正质量
 
评分计算
 
 
 
豆瓣的评分为10分制，goodreads评分为5分制，所以在统计的时候会将goodreads的分数乘2来统计，下述表格的分数为10分制
 
 
目前入选的书籍是各版本在两个平台总评价人数&gt;500，后续会再列出&gt;100的一个列表，会有更多新出版/小众的书籍
 
 
书名转向的链接为对应书籍在豆瓣的有评分且比较相对新版本的链接，不一定是最新版，有可能最新版本还没有出评分，或最新版为英文版等，后续会进一步整理
 
 
后续待补充内容
 
数据目前还在简单检查，后续定义好格式后会将下述内容添加到表格：
 
 
 
提供英文版本（正在）
 
 
表格中的每本书可以点击展开折叠，提供每本书不同版本的详细信息，豆瓣和googreads链接，每本的评分等
 
 
提供每本书的相关tag，方便筛选（正在）
 
 
因某些书籍可能由于某一版本的翻译/质量问题会拉低平均分，提供单本书的排行列表
 
 
提供人数大于100的排行
 
 
提供单本(不考虑同一本书的所有其他版次)的排行

                    <span>A new operating system kernel with Linux binary compatibility written in Rust.

Kerla
 

 

 
Kerla is a monolithic operating system kernel from scratch in Rust which aims to be compatible with the Linux ABI, that is, runs Linux binaries without any modifications.
 
 
 
Implements *NIX process concepts: context switching, signals, fork(2), execve(2), wait4(2), etc.
 
 
Supports commonly used system calls like write(2), stat(2), mmap(2), pipe(2), poll(2), ...
 
 
No disk support for now: initramfs is mounted as the root file system.
 
 
Pseudo file systems: tmpfs and devfs.
 
 
smoltcp-based TCP/IP support.
 
 
Implements tty and pseudo terminal (pty).
 
 
Supports QEMU and Firecracker (with virtio-net device driver).
 
 
Supports x86_64.
 
 
Docker-based initramfs build system.

GreenPass-Experiments
 
This project was started with the intention of violating the Italian GreenPass which should serve in theory to prevent the spread of COVID-19 but which in my opinion is not very effective. This is because vaccinated people can contract the virus and can be contagious. In addition, the GreenPass limits personal freedom even more with senseless measures that even prevent you from working, for example in schools where all the students, who are used to moving in crowded public transport do not have to show any GreenPass while the teachers who are mostly at a distance behind the desk and they use their private cars must have the GreenPass to work.

Cloud Comparer
 
This is the second version of my Cloud Comparison slide deck which I prepared a year back (can be downloaded here: http://www.slideshare.net/ilyas_it83/microsoft-azure-vs-amazon-web-services-aws-services-feature-mapping). The version 1 recieved more than 22K views and 400+ download at the time of working on this project. This gave me the idea of creating a robust and dependable comparison/mapping between the various services offered by the major cloud providers in a lively and updatable format.
 
The project is open sourced to let fellow Cloud Architects, IT Pros, Developers to feel free to edit and update the comparison upto date.

Abstract
 
Multi-object tracking (MOT) aims at estimating bounding boxes and identities of objects in videos. Most methods obtain identities by associating detection boxes whose scores are higher than a threshold. The objects with low detection scores, e.g. occluded objects, are simply thrown away, which brings non-negligible true object missing and fragmented trajectories. To solve this problem, we present a simple, effective and generic associati…</span>

候选论文
 
考虑在之后视频中将要介绍的论文。选取的原则是10年内深度学习里有影响力文章（必读文章），或者近期比较有意思的文章。当然这十年里重要的工作太多了，不可能一一过一遍。在选取的时候我会偏向一些之前 直播课 中没讲到过的。 欢迎大家在 讨论区 里提供（点）建议（歌）。
 
录一篇文章的时间大概是5个小时（录制、剪辑、上传），这里不算上读文章的时间。我一般是每天深夜找半个小时或者一个小时做一点。如果没有其他更紧要的事情的话，10天左右可以出一篇。如果大家热情 加⭐  话，可以多赶一赶🤣
 
下面列表将会持续更新（数字不代表讲的顺序）。
 
 
 
Adam。深度学习里最常用的优化算法之一。
 
 
EfficientNet。通过架构搜索得到的CNN，现在常被使用。
 
 
BERT。让深度学习在NLP上热度超过了CV。
 
 
GPT3。朝着zero-shot learning迈了一大步。当然也得讲一讲GPT/GPT-2
 
 
GAN。生成类模型中的开创性工作。
 
 
CLIP。图片分类从此不用标数据。
 
 
Non-deep networks。21年10月的新工作，让不深的网络也能在ImageNet刷到SOTA。
 
 
为什么超大的模型泛化性不错
 
 
GNN介绍。Distill上最近一篇写得很好的介绍性文章。
 
 
AlphaGo。让强化学习出圈的一系列工作。</span>

天涯神贴「2010年的房地产调控，我们收获了什么？写在房价暴涨前」脱水版，内容时间顺序和原贴一致，原贴中的优质非楼主写的内容，添加了引用格式便于区分。
 
 
除标题外，所有内容均来自原贴，标题是我简单加的，目的是为了做目录，便于查看。
 
 
帖子里的内容还没有整理完，待全部整理完：
 
 
 
  
对 kkndme 的观点有了完整的认识后，我会在公众号沈正方上写写我对这个帖子内容的思考
 
  
其次，我会把本仓库的内容做成PDF，通过公众号沈正方发出去，欢迎关注一起讨论！

调控降房价是刚需的一厢情愿 
  
 
   
1、人人都有居住权。房子是用来住的，不是用来炒的。
 
   
2、房子太贵了，租售比严重不合理，空置率太高，人均收入太低，早晚要崩盘。
 
   
3、房价上涨造成物价上涨，人民生活变得困难
 
  
  
 
调控的真正目的：防范金融风险 &amp; 通过垄断实现gj利益最大化
 
 
官方公布的统计数据，只要关系到某个群体的利益，就一定会被修饰导致失真
 
 
税收从来都是向下游转嫁的 &amp; 房产税迟迟不出台的真正原因
 
 
房地产的现状
 
 
房价持续上涨的本质是稀缺性让好房子成为资金最好的去处
 
 
关于垄断 
  
 
   
1、垄断的好处是没有风险
 
   
2、垄断可以解决社会稳定
 
   
3、房屋垄断只会愈演愈烈，底层人民想要拥有一套房子的难度只会越来越难

Build
 
To build the necessary binaries, we can just clone the repo, and use the provided Makefile to build the project. This will download the trusted setup params, and compile the source code.
 
$ git clone https://github.com/darkrenaissance/darkfi
$ make

 
Install
 
This will install the binaries and configurations in the configured namespace (/usr/local by default). The configurations are installed as TOML files in /usr/local/share/doc/darkfi. They have to be copied in your user&#x27;s $HOME/.config/darkfi directory. You can review the installed config files, but the defaults should be good for using the testnet if you&#x27;re following this document.

Docker Bench for Security
 

 
The Docker Bench for Security is a script that checks for dozens of common best-practices around deploying Docker containers in production. The tests are all automated, and are based on the CIS Docker Benchmark v1.3.1.
 
We are making this available as an open-source utility so the Docker community can have an easy way to self-assess their hosts and docker containers against this benchmark.
 
Running Docker Bench for Security
 
Run from your base host
 
You can simply run this script from your base host by running:
 
git clone https://github.com/docker/docker-bench-security.git

ArchTitus Installer Script
 
 
This README contains the steps I do to install and configure a fully-functional Arch Linux installation containing a desktop environment, all the support packages (network, bluetooth, audio, printers, etc.), along with all my preferred applications and utilities. The shell scripts in this repo allow the entire process to be automated.)
 
 
Create Arch ISO or Use Image
 
Download ArchISO from https://archlinux.org/download/ and put on a USB drive with Ventoy or Etcher
 
If you don&#x27;t want to build using this script I did create an image @ https://www.christitus.com/arch-titus
 
Boot Arch ISO
 
From initial Prompt type the following commands:
 
pacman -Sy git
git clone https://github.com/ChrisTitusTech/ArchTitus
cd ArchTitus
./archtitus.sh

 
System Description
 
This is completely automated arch install of the KDE desktop environment on arch using all the packages I use on a daily basis.

Introduction
 
Design patterns are the best formalized practices a programmer can use to solve common problems when designing an application or system.
 
Design patterns can speed up the development process by providing tested, proven development paradigms.
 
Reusing design patterns help prevent subtle issues that cause major problems, and it also improves code readability for coders and architects who are familiar with the patterns.

重要说明
 
 
 
 JD部分较少任务无法判断是等待还是即刻返回，故有些任务需要等待30S自动返回，后续看能不能解决
  
 
 JD的活动界面没办法获得它控件属性那些，这次版本使用的是坐标点击的，可能会有一些问题
  
 
 JDTB如果没办法自动进入做任务界面，请手动进入
  
 
 JD有个别活动是跳过的，比如需要开会员的，比如分享的，还有下单的
  
 
 JD目前有个任务没时间去做，参与城城领钱的，建议手动完成
  
 
 TB要先做好新手教程

What is OceanBase database
 
OceanBase Database is a native distributed relational database. It is developed entirely by Alibaba and Ant Group. OceanBase Database is built on a common server cluster. Based on the Paxos protocol and its distributed structure, OceanBase Database provides high availability and linear scalability. OceanBase Database is not dependent on specific hardware architectures.

About
 
Almost all of these live on dockerhub under jess. Because you cannot use notary with autobuilds on dockerhub I also build these continuously on a private registry at r.j3ss.co for public download. (You&#x27;re welcome.)

You may also want to checkout my dotfiles, specifically the aliases for all these files which are here: github.com/jessfraz/dotfiles/blob/master/.dockerfunc.
 
Contributing
 
I try to make sure each Dockerfile has a command at the top to document running it, if a file you are looking at does not have a command, please pull request it!

Building
 
1. Install rustc, cargo and rustfmt.
 
$ curl https://sh.rustup.rs -sSf | sh
$ source $HOME/.cargo/env
$ rustup component add rustfmt

 
When building the master branch, please make sure you are using the latest stable rust version by running:
 
$ rustup update

 
When building a specific release branch, you should check the rust version in ci/rust-version.sh and if necessary, install that version by running:
 
$ rustup install VERSION

 
Note that if this is not the latest rust version on your machine, cargo commands may require an override in order to use the correct version.
 
On Linux systems you may need to install libssl-dev, pkg-config, zlib1g-dev, etc. On Ubuntu:

simdjson : Parsing gigabytes of JSON per second
 
 JSON is everywhere on the Internet. Servers spend a *lot* of time parsing it. We need a fresh approach. The simdjson library uses commonly available SIMD instructions and microparallel algorithms to parse JSON 4x faster than RapidJSON and 25x faster than JSON for Modern C++. 
 
 
Fast: Over 4x faster than commonly used production-grade JSON parsers.
 
 
Record Breaking Features: Minify JSON at 6 GB/s, validate UTF-8 at 13 GB/s, NDJSON at 3.5 GB/s.
 
 
Easy: First-class, easy to use and carefully documented APIs.
 
 
Strict: Full JSON and UTF-8 validation, lossless parsing. Performance with no compromises.
 
 
Automatic: Selects a CPU-tailored parser at runtime. No configuration needed.

Binary releases
 
 
Build from source
 
 
Usage
 
The preferred way to configure the miner is the JSON config file as it is more flexible and human friendly. The command line interface does not cover all features, such as mining profiles for different algorithms. Important options can be changed during runtime without miner restart by editing the config file or executing API calls.
 
 
 
Wizard helps you create initial configuration for the miner.
 
 
Workers helps manage your miners via HTTP API.

Welcome to dotnet sdk
 
This repo contains core functionality needed to create .NET projects that is shared between VisualStudio and CLI.
 
 
 
MSBuild tasks can be found under /src/Tasks/Microsoft.NET.Build.Tasks/.
 
 
Please refer to dotnet/project-system for the project system work that is specific to Visual Studio.

Latest builds
 
How do I engage and contribute?
 
We welcome you to try things out, file issues, make feature requests and join us in design conversations. Also be sure to check out our project documentation
 
This project has adopted the .NET Foundation Code of Conduct to clarify expected behavior in our community.
 
How do I build the SDK?
 
Start with the Developer Guide.
 
How do I test an SDK I have built?
 
To test your locally built SDK, run eng\dogfood.cmd after building. That script starts a new Powershell with the environment configured to redirect SDK resolution to your build.
 
From that shell your SDK will be available in:
 
 
 
any Visual Studio instance launched (via &amp; devenv.exe)
 
 
dotnet build
 
 
msbuild
 
 
How we triage and review PRs
 
With the SDK repo being the home for many different areas, we&#x27;ve started trying to label incoming issues for the area they are related to using Area- labels. Then we rely on the codeowners to manage and triages issues in their areas. Feel free to ping the owners listed in that file if you&#x27;re not getting traction on a particular issue or PR. Please try to label new issues as that&#x27;ll help us route them faster.
 
For PRs, we assign out a reviewer once a week on Wednesday looking only at PRs that are green in the build. If you are contributing, please get the PR green including a test if possible and then ping @dotnet-cli if you want to raise visibility of the PR.</span>

Chatwoot is an open-source omnichannel customer support software. The development of Chatwoot started in 2016. It failed to succeed as a business and eventually shut up shop in 2017. During 2019 #Hacktoberfest, the maintainers decided to make it open-source, instead of letting the code rust in a private repo. With a pleasant surprise, Chatwoot became a trending project on Hacker News and best of all, got lots of love from the community. Now, a failed project is back on track and the prospects are looking great. The team is back to working on …</span>

Compatibility with Tesseract 3 is enabled by using the Legacy OCR Engine mode (--oem 0). It also needs traineddata files which support the legacy engine, for example those…</span>

                    <span>A unique technique to execute binaries from a password protected zip

ZipExec
 
ZipExec is a Proof-of-Concept (POC) tool to wrap binary-based tools into a password-protected zip file. This zip file is then base64 encoded into a string that is rebuilt on disk. This encoded string is then loaded into a JScript file that when executed, would rebuild the password-protected zip file on disk and execute it. This is done programmatically by using COM objects to access the GUI-based functions in Windows via the generated JScript loader, executing the loader inside the password-protected zip without having to unzip it first. By password protecting the zip file, it protects the binary from EDRs and disk-based or anti-malware scanning mechanisms.
 
 
Installation
 
The first step as always is to clone the repo. Before you compile ZipExec you&#x27;ll need to install the dependencies. To install them, run following commands:
 
go get github.com/yeka/zip

 
Then build it
 
go build ZipExec.go

 
or
 
go get github.com/Tylous/ZipExec 
 
Help
 
./ZipExec -h

                    <span>Super_Mario
 
 
 
Hello all this is a simple python program which tries to use our body as a controller for the super mario game
 
 
Here I have used media pipe to detect the body posture
 
 
then based on the based posture I have stimulated the keyboard input using pynput module of the python
 
 
as single press of the key is not sufficient to make the mario move I have used multithreading concept to simulataneously run different methods
 
 
In order to run this program in your machine just install the dependencies like opencv, mediapipe, pynput and run the main.py file
 
 
after that stand in front of the camera in center position
 
 
Thats it you are good to go now</span>

                    <span>This is a crypto trading bot that scans the Binance Annoucements page for new coins, and places trades on Gateio

gateio-trading-bot-binance-announcements
 
This Gateio x Binance cryptocurrency trading bot scans the Binance Announcements page and picks up on new coin listings. It then goes to Gateio and places a buy order on the coin that&#x27;s due to be listed on Binance. It comes with trailing stop loss, take profit and a test mode.
 
The idea behind this open source crypto trading algorithm to take advantage of the price spike of new coins as they are being announced for listing on Binance. As Gateio seems to list many of these coins before Binance does, this exchange is a good place to start. It comes with a live and test mode so naturally, use at your own risk.

Pixie is an open source observability tool for Kubernetes applications. Use Pixie to view the high-level state of your cluster (service maps, cluster resources, application traffic) and also drill-down into more detailed views (pod state, flame graphs, individual full-body application requests).
 
Why Pixie?
 
Three features enable Pixie&#x27;s magical developer experience:
 
 
 
 Auto-telemetry: Pixie uses eBPF to automatically collect telemetry data such as full-body requests, resource and network metrics, application profiles, and more. See the full list of data sources here.
  
 
 In-Cluster Edge Compute: Pixie collects, stores and queries all telemetry data locally in the cluster. Pixie uses less than 5% of cluster CPU, …</span>

Polkadot
 
Implementation of a https://polkadot.network node in Rust based on the Substrate framework.
 
 
 
NOTE: In 2018, we split our implementation of &quot;Polkadot&quot; from its development framework &quot;Substrate&quot;. See the Substrate repo for git history prior to 2018.
 
 
This repo contains runtimes for the Polkadot, Kusama, and Westend networks. The README provides information about installing the polkadot binary and developing on the codebase. For more specific guides, like how to be a validator, see the Polkadot Wiki.
 
Installation
 
If you just wish to run a Polkadot node without compiling it yourself, you may either run the latest binary from our releases page, or install Polkadot from one of our package repositories.

Non-deep Networks 
 arXiv:2110.07641 
 Ankit Goyal, Alexey Bochkovskiy, Jia Deng, Vladlen Koltun
 
 
 Overview: Depth is the hallmark of DNNs. But more depth means more sequential computation and higher latency. This begs the question -- is it possible to build high-performing &#x60;&#x60;non-deep&quot; neural networks? We show that it is. We show, for the first time, that a network with a depth of just 12 can achieve top-1 accuracy over 80% on ImageNet, 96% on CIFAR10, and 81% on CIFAR100. We also show that a network with a low-depth (12) backbone can achieve an AP of 48% on MS-COCO.

What is PolarDB-X ？
 
PolarDB-X is a cloud native distributed SQL Database designed for high concurrency, massive storage, complex querying scenarios. It has a shared-nothing architecture in which computing is decoupled from storage. It supports horizontal scaling, distributed transactions and Hybrid Transactional and Analytical Processing (HTAP) workloads, and is characterized by enterprise-class, cloud native, high availability, highly compatiable with MySQL and its ecosystem.
 
PolarDB-X was originally created to solve the database&#x27;s scalability bottleneck of Alibaba Tmall&#x27;s &quot;Double Eleven&quot; core transaction system, and has grown with AliCloud along…</span>

                    <span>Introduction
 
Much of this guide is specific to Voron printers running Klipper. Rather than re-hashing concepts already described in Voron/Klipper documentation, I will be frequently linking to them and adding additional information and methods that utilize those concepts.
 
This is not intended to be an ultimate guide to everything, rather a guide to address common mistakes and confusion I see in the Voron Discord.
 
(!) Please pay special attention to anything bolded and marked with &quot;(!)&quot;
 
My SuperSlicer profiles are located here.
 
I am adding new information all the time, be sure to check back.
 If you have issues, comments, or suggestions, please let me know on Discord: Ellis#4980
 
Thank you to bythorsthunder for help with testing these methods and providing some of the photos.

Lottie is a mobile library for Android and iOS that natively renders vector based animations and art in realtime with minimal code.
 
Lottie loads and renders animations and vectors exported in the bodymovin JSON format. Bodymovin JSON can be created and exported from After Effects with bodymovin, Sketch with Lottie Sketch Export, and from Haiku.
 
For the first time, designers can create and ship beautiful animations without an engineer painstakingly recreating it by hand. Since the animation is backed by JSON they are extremely small in size but can be large in complexity! Animations can be pla…</span>

Coding Interview University
 
 
 
I originally created this as a short to-do list of study topics for becoming a software engineer, but it grew to the large list you see today. After going through this study plan, I got hired as a Software Development Engineer at Amazon! You probably won&#x27;t have to study as much as I did. Anyway, everything you need is here.
 
 
I studied about 8-12 hours a day, for several months. This is my story: Why I studied full-time for 8 months for a Google interview
 
 
Please Note: You won&#x27;t need to study as much as I did. I wasted a lot of time on things I didn&#x27;t need to know. More info about that below. I&#x27;ll help you get there without wasting your precious time.

MuJoCo stands for Multi-Joint dynamics with Contact. It is a general purpose physics engine that aims to facilitate research and development in robotics, biomechanics, graphics and animation, machine learning, and other areas which demand fast and accurate simulation of articulated structures interacting with their environment.
 
DeepMind has acquired MuJoCo, and we are currently making preparations to open source the codebase. In the meantime, MuJoCo is available for download as a free and unrestricted precompiled binary under the Apache 2.0 license from mujoco.org.

 (Project archived oct. 18th 2021) 

  
eDEX-UI is a fullscreen, cross-platform terminal emulator and system monitor that looks and feels like a sci-fi computer interface.
 
 
   
Heavily inspired from the TRON Legacy movie effects (especially the Board Room sequence), the eDEX-UI project was originally meant to be &quot;DEX-UI with less « art » and more « distributable software »&quot;.
 
While keeping a futuristic look and feel, it strives to maintain a certain level of functionality and to be usable in real-life scenarios, with the larger goal of bringing science-fiction UXs to the mainstream.
 
 
It might or might not be a joke taken too seriously.

What is Datree?
 
Datree is a CLI tool that supports Kubernetes admins in their roles by preventing developers from making errors in Kubernetes configurations that can cause clusters to fail in production. Our CLI tool is open source, enabling it to be supported by the Kubernetes community.
 
It’s far more effective than manual processes, such as sending an email to a slew of developers, begging them to set various limits, which likely falls on deaf ears because developers are already overwhelmed.

JAX is Autograd and XLA, brought together for high-performance machine learning research.
 
With its updated version of Autograd, JAX can automatically differentiate native Python and NumPy functions. It can differentiate through loops, branches, recursion, and closures, and it can take derivatives of derivatives of derivatives.

Puppeteer is a Node library which provides a high-level API to control Chrome or Chromium over the DevTools Protocol. Puppeteer runs headless by default, but can be configured to run full (non-headless) Chrome or Chromium.

Most things that you can do manually in the browser can be done using Puppeteer! Here are a few examples to get you started:

Slate lets you build rich, intuitive editors like those in Medium, Dropbox Paper or Google Docs—which are becoming table stakes for applications on the web—without your codebase getting mired in complexity.
 
It can do this because all of its logic is implemented with a series of plugins, so you aren&#x27;t ever constrained by what is or isn&#x27;t in &quot;core&quot;. You can think of it like a pluggable implementation of contenteditable built on top of React. It was inspired by libraries like Draft.js, Prosemirror and Quill.

⚙ 构建
 
自行构建前需要拥有 Go &gt;&#x3D; 1.13、yarn等必要依赖。
 
克隆代码
 
git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/cloudreve/Cloudreve.git

 
构建静态资源
 
# 进入前端子模块
cd assets
# 安装依赖
yarn install
# 开始构建
yarn run build

 
嵌入静态资源
 
# 回到项目主目录
cd ../

# 安装 statik, 用于嵌入静态资源
go get github.com/rakyll/statik

# 开始嵌入
statik -src&#x3D;assets/build/  -include&#x3D;*.html,*.js,*.json,*.css,*.png,*.svg,*.ico -f

 
编译项目
 
# 获得当前版本号、Commit
export COMMIT_SHA&#x3D;$(git rev-parse --short HEAD)
export VERSION&#x3D;$(git describe --tags)

# 开始编译
go build -a -o cloudreve -ldflags &quot; -X &#x27;github.com/cloudreve/Cloudreve/v3/pkg/conf.BackendVersion&#x3D;$VERSION&#x27; -X &#x27;github.com/cloudreve/Cloudreve/v3/pkg/conf.LastCommit&#x3D;$COMMIT_SHA&#x27;&quot;

 
你也可以使用项目根目录下的build.sh快速开始构建：
 
./build.sh  [-a] [-c] [-b] [-r]
	a - 构建静态资源
	c - 编译二进制文件
	b - 构建前端 + 编译二进制文件
	r - 交叉编译，构建用于release的版本

📚 Awesome cheatsheets for popular programming languages, frameworks and development tools. They include everything you should know in one single file.
 
 
🤔 Why Awesome-Cheatsheets?
 
I usually make a cheat sheet when I want to improve my skills in a programming language, a framework or a development tool. I started doing these kinds of things a long time ago on Gist. To better keep track of the history and to let people contribute, I reorganized all of them into this single repository. Most of the content is coming from official documentation and some books I have read.

目前还在规范整个流程，权限，合法性，也有在联系律师同学的帮助，在规范完之后会开放下载。请各位放心！
 
项目介绍
 
Worker Lives Matter！ WorkingTime 是由中国民间程序员发起的一个项目，针对目前包括互联网企业在内的各个企业加班盛行且无监管的现状，上线了一个在线作息编辑表格。上线仅两天就收获了上千条各个企业精确到部门的作息情况和工作氛围等信息，几十万的浏览次数，上百人同时在线查看。随着文档的扩散，打工人们分享的信息中不仅局限于互联网企业，还包含了金融行业，事业单位，建筑行业等各行各业企业部门的作息情况，我们打工人也需要生活！！！！
 
此项目依托于各位打工人们的无私奉献，旨在为在各行各业的打工人提供各个公司的作息时间，为打工人们在做职业选择的时候提供尽量准确的参考。
 
大家分享的信息我们也会定时在此仓库进行更新，造福打工人！
 
如何奉献自己的一份力
 
我们在维护此项目期间收到了很多仁人志士的帮助和建议，在此先感谢所有为此项目提供数据和为此项目建言献策的各位同胞！
 
然后，如果您愿意分享自己部门的作息情况，请点击 https://docs.qq.com/form/page/DUUdPbWhnWVF3ekh6 此问卷，发布自己公司部门的作息时间以及其他信息。（本来之前是直接在表格编辑，但是遭到了不怀好意者的恶意增删，所以我们只能以填问卷的形式自动增加内容，望同胞们理解！）

🔥 这是什么？
 
笔者在学会 JS 以及框架的应用后，有一段时间不知道该如何深入下去，活能干，就是不知道该学啥。相信这个问题也会有很多读者朋友遇到。
 
当然笔者目前已经突破了这个瓶颈，也成为了知名公司基础架构组的成员。因此想通过自己成长的经历及积累的资料整理出一系列的学习路线及资料推荐，帮助各位读者朋友解决这个问题。
 
 
 
笔者会列出所有前端必学及热门领域的学习路径及推荐资料，比如浏览器、性能优化、框架、工程化、算法等等，工程浩大，大家可以持续关注该项目！
 
 
此资料适用于小白入门、初中级进阶、高级查漏补缺。
 
内容每天都在更新，大家可以持续关注。
 
💻 如何使用
 
如果你是初中级工程师来说，笔者也推荐先行学习「前端核心学习路径」，主要是巩固基础，之后再挑选感兴趣的主题。
 
如果你是高级工程师，笔者推荐跳过「前端核心学习路径」，直接挑选感兴趣的主题学习即可。
 
以下所有知识点笔者都会帮助读者朋友们将知识连贯起来，从而建立自己的知识体系而不是单独记忆松散的知识点。
 
推荐大家 Star 并 Fork 本项目（点击仓库顶部右上角按钮），然后 git clone 到本地后从上至下逐步完成学习计划。

TensorFlow is an end-to-end open source platform for machine learning. It has a comprehensive, flexible ecosystem of tools, libraries, and community resources that lets researchers push the state-of-the-art in ML and developers easily build and deploy ML-powered applications.
 
TensorFlow was originally developed by researchers and engineers working on the Google Brain team within Google&#x27;s Machine Intelligence Research organization to conduct machine learning and deep neural networks research. The system is general enough to be applicable in a wide variety of other domains, as well.

Overview
 
Prompt-learning is the latest paradigm to adapt pre-trained language models (PLMs) to downstream NLP tasks, which modifies the input text with a textual template and directly uses PLMs to conduct pre-trained tasks. This library provides a standard, flexible and extensible framework to deploy the prompt-learning pipeline. OpenPrompt supports loading PLMs directly from huggingface transformers. In the future, we will also support PLMs implemented by other libraries.

Abstract: We observe that despite their hierarchical convolutional nature, the synthesis process of typical generative adversarial networks depends on absolute pixel coordinates in an unhealthy manner. This manifests itself as, e.g., detail appearing to be glued to image coordinates instead of the surfaces of depicted objects. We trace the root cause to careless signal processing that causes aliasing in the generator network. Interpreting all signals…</span>

Fast Facebook Activity Deletion
 
This program can be used to clean up a facebook account without deleting the entire account.
 
Note: Facebook has a very strange login process. Please open a GitHub issue if the program is not able to login.
 

 
Run program
 
Binaries for Linux, macOS and Windows are attached to a release.
 
Download binary
 
Download the binary file for your platform of the latest release.
 
Linux/macOS: Make the binary executable and run it. Example:
 
$ chmod +x deleter-linux
$ ./deleter-linux

 
Windows: Run the .exe file and select &quot;More information&quot; and &quot;Run anyway&quot;.
 
From source
 
A recent Go version needs to be installed. This can be done via your package manager or the golang website.
 
Clone this repository
 
$ git clone https://github.com/marcelja/facebook-delete.git
$ cd facebook-delete
$ go install
$ go run deleter.go

 
Cookies
 
Cookies are saved to $HOME/.go-cookies if the $GOCOOKIES variable is not set (see https://github.com/juju/persistent-cookiejar).
 
Options
 
Rate-limiting
 
Facebook will temp-block you if you make too many requests too quickly. Run the command with the -rateLimit  to introduce a delay before each request. If you&#x27;re getting hung up on just searches or deletes, you can disable rate-limiting for one or the other with -limitSearch&#x3D;0 or -limitDelete&#x3D;0.
 
E.g. one of:
 
$ ./deleter-linux -rateLimit 500
$ ./deleter-linux -rateLimit 500 -limitSearch&#x3D;0
$ ./deleter-linux -rateLimit 500 -limitDelete&#x3D;0</span>

说明
 

 
 
 
本项目是一个超迷你的智能小终端，集成LVGL图像框架、MVC框架、消息框架、WiFi蓝牙能力，未来会加入触摸屏支持。可以作为智能控制器用于实现很多应用。
 
 
另外我正在上面实现一个非常小型的3D引擎，可以用于动态显示一些3D模型（就像Dummy示教器中展示的那样）。
 
 
非常感谢 https://github.com/FASTSHIFT 开源的X-Track项目，本文是对于X-Track硬件和固件往ESP32平台移植的记录说明。
 
1. 硬件移植
 
关于芯片选型
 
主要考虑MCU的Flash、SRAM、SPI速度，需要满足以下要求：
 
 
 
主频 &gt; 150MHz
 
 
RAM &gt;&#x3D; 200KB
 
 
FLASH &gt;&#x3D; 512KB
 
 
SPI速度 &gt;&#x3D; 50Mbps（60fps刷新率的要求）
 
 
 
 
lvgl中需要设置LCD buffer，一般设置为屏幕分辨率大小，在本项目中为240x240x2（因为是16bit色深所以每个像素2字节），算下来至少需要112KB的SRAM。
 
 
SPI的CLK速度计算如下：240x240x2x8x60&#x3D;55.296MHz，因此最好是达到50MHz以上的频率才能保证刷新流畅（实际上不使用DMA传输数据的话帧率会更低）。
 
 
经过筛选满足以上要求的MCU，综合考虑成本和购买渠道问题，除了官方项目使用的雅特力AT32F403ACGU7主控外，还有两款是比较合适的：STM32F405RGT6、ESP32。
 
对比优缺点如下：
 
 
 
STM32F405的主频不如ESP32高且后者为双核；

OpenWrt Project is a Linux operating system targeting embedded devices. Instead of trying to create a single, static firmware, OpenWrt provides a fully writable filesystem with package management. This frees you from the application selection and configuration provided by the vendor and allows you to customize the device through the use of packages to suit any application.

                    <span>Smart NFC &amp; ink-Display Card

[L-ink]电子墨水屏NFC智能卡片
 
 
 
这是为了解决个人使用IC卡时遇到的一些痛点设计的一个迷你NFC智能卡片，基于STM32L051和ST25DV。
 
 
想着既然要自制这玩意那就往炫酷了做，于是很自觉地把电子墨水屏也加上了，顺手也写了个配套APP用于显示内容定制。
 
 
总之是个比较有意思的小项目，方案不算复杂，第一版设计也存在一些值得改进的地方，后续有空会继续优化方案设计的。

项目文件说明
 
 
 
Hardware：source里面是电路原理图和PCB文件，使用Altium Designer打开；release里面是gerber文件可以直接发给厂家打样，也包含了元器件BOM表（部分IC不太常用可能要单独购买）。
 
 
Firmware：STM32L051的固件，我提供了Clion和Keil两个版本的工程文件，源码内容是一致的，分两个版本只是因为个人对Clion爱得深沉。
 
 
3D Model：屏幕架和外壳的3D文件，step格式一般3D建模软件都能打开编辑，STL格式用于直接3D打印。
 
 
DAP-Link：自己设计的下载调试器的硬件和固件源码，也包括预编译的hex固件，如果你有J-Link或者ST-Link之类的下载器就不用这个了。
 
 
Android：配套的APP安装包。
 
 
固件编译说明
 
STM32因为使用了L0系列的MCU，所以如果你是第一次在你的电脑上开发STM32L0，那么需要先装一下L0的固件支持包，有两种方式：
 
 
 
 使用STM32CubMX安装：
 
 
  
 
 使用Keil的Package Installer安装：
 
 
  
 
然后就不会报头文件的错误了。
 
有几点注意的：
 
 
 
如果想在Clion中编译工程的话可以参考我这篇教程：https://zhuanlan.zhihu.com/p/145801160
 
 
Clion中OpenOCD默认是使用ST-Link下载，其他下载器自己修改工程目录下的stlink.cfg文件
 
 
关于硬件方案
 
硬件方案比较简单，主要IC就两个--STM32和ST25DV，电子墨水屏是200x200的单色屏幕，我是买的微雪的（注意如果是买的几年前的库存，那驱动芯片会有点区别导致代码不通用，只要是新款的应该都没问题）。
 
ST25DV作为NFC的PHY通过I2C总线和STM32通信，主要作用有两个：能量采集以及NFC通信。注意，ST25DV只是负责和手机进行NFC通信，而不负责IC卡的读写功能，因为ST25DV只支持ISO 15693的RFID协议，而我们常用的IC卡（M1卡）是ISO 14443协议的，所以并不能直接使用这颗芯片进行IC卡模拟。
 
IC卡的模拟功能这一版中实现得比较简单，就是直接集成了多颗UID芯片（很便宜，1~2元一片），然后和ST25DV共用NFC天线，卡片的切换是通过拨轮换挡实现的。好处在于，你可以把L-ink当作多张独立卡片的合集处理，复制和刷卡都是很直接的（使用PM3或者PN532等模块读取原卡信息并写入L-link）。当然缺点就是添加的卡片一多，按键的数量就要增加（因为每一档对应一张卡）。
 
所以我也在改进方案，后面可能会使用支持ISO 14443协议的ST95或者ST25T系列的芯片来实现软件层面的IC卡模拟功能。
 
另外下一个版本的硬件方案我会把黑白的电子墨水屏换成彩色的。
 
关于配套APP
 
Android APP目前只是实现了功能，这是基于我以前做的一个算法验证框架APP改的，UI还没有重新做设计，可以等后续更新。
 
工程文件的话我后面可以把其中的核心功能模块封装成Module，然后给个Sample Project供参考使用，工作太忙等我缓过这阵子先~

                    <span>我终于能用谷歌搜中文了……

中文搜索结果黑名单
 
垃圾站点出现在 Google、百度的中文搜索结果中，实在是恶心——于是这个黑名单就这么出来了。
 
黑名单主要由我自己使用 Google 搜索时收集（ 当然，也离不开来自网友的热心分享、提交 ），所以更新频率无法保证。然而已经断断续续更新了 4 年，就职的公司都被收购了，部门也换了 4 次。
 
如何使用
 
安装以下插件导入黑名单，插件选其中之一即可。
 
强烈建议使用 uBlacklist，因为该插件可以对搜索结果标题进行匹配（ 即下方提到的“模糊匹配” ）。例如，Google 搜索结果中可能有成百上千的“小 X 百科网”、“小 X 知识网”，以域名匹配的方式几乎是不可能的（ 即下方提到的“精确匹配” ）。这时用正则模糊匹配结果标题，将会非常简单。
 
同理，由于 Google Hit Hider by Domain 和 AC-baidu 没有匹配标题的功能，屏蔽效果会比 uBlacklist 差。
 
屏蔽 Google 中文搜索结果
 
1. uBlacklist（ 下载地址：Chrome Web Store、Firefox Add-ons、Mac App Store ）
 
 
 
 将以下 2 个链接，通过点击 Add a subscription 添加到 Subscription 分类下。
 
  
 
   
 精确匹配：该匹配方式主要是通过 *://*.xxxx.com/* 的方式来匹配搜索结果，进行过滤。基本不会有误杀。
  
   
 模糊匹配：该匹配方式主要是通过如 *://*/list.php?s&#x3D;*、title/小.(百科|知识)网/ 的方式来匹配搜索结果，进行过滤。存在小范围的误杀。
  
  
  
 
2. Google Hit Hider by Domain（ 下载地址：GreasyFork ）
 
 
 
将该列表中的网址，通过 List Until -&gt; Import 进行导入。
 
 
屏蔽百度中文搜索结果
 
1. Google Hit Hider by Domain（ 下载地址：GreasyFork ）
 
 
 
同 Google 方案操作。
 
 
2. AC-baidu（ 下载地址：GreasyFork ）
 
 
 
开启“附加2-自主拦截域名”，点击 DIY，将该列表中的网址导入。
 
 
 
 
注：这个脚本似乎也会同时对搜狗、谷歌、必应搜索结果同时产生影响。

CTO (Call Tree Overviewer)
 
CTO (Call Tree Overviewer) is an IDA plugin for creating a simple and efficiant function call tree graph. It can also summarize function information such as internal function calls, API calls, static linked library function calls, unresolved function calls, string references, structure member accesses, specific comments.
 
CTO has another helper plugin named &quot;CTO Function Lister&quot;, although it can work as a standalone tool. You can think this is an enhanced version of functions window. It lists functions with summarized important information, which is the same as the CTO&#x27;s one. You can use a regex filter to find nodes with a specific pattern as well.

                    <span>Engine for making things with a MS-DOS feel, but for modern platforms


 
dos-like
 

 
dos-like is a programming library/framework, kind of like a tiny game engine, for writing games and programs with a similar feel to MS-DOS productions from the early 90s. But rather than writing code that would run on a real DOS machine, dos-like is about making programs which runs on modern platforms like Windows, Mac and Linux, but which attempts to recreate the look, feel, and sound of old DOS programs.
 
It includes a bunch of examples of classic DOS techniques and effects, a few of which can be seen above.

                    <span>基于 Rust + eBPF 丢弃 GFW DNS 污染包

Clean DNS with eBPF
 
基于 Rust + eBPF 丢弃 GFW DNS 污染包
 
 
 
注：只在 Linux 上能用，且需要内核支持 XDP。
 
 
How to Use
 
 
 
下载 最新的 release
 
 
想要加载到内核时(记得修改 eth0 为你的出口网卡名，以及修改 clean-dns.elf 的路径): 
sudo ip link set dev eth0 xdp obj ./clean-dns.elf

 正常使用的话，只需要在网卡 ready 后把 elf 挂上去就行了（重启后需再次挂载）。
 
 
当你想从内核卸载这个 bpf 时(同样，记得修改 eth0 为你的网卡名)： 
sudo ip link set dev eth0 xdp off

 正常使用无需卸载。
 
 
Features
 
当挂在本 bpf 后，对应网卡上到 8.8.8.8:53 的 DNS 请求对应响应上的 GFW 污染会被过滤掉。
 
即你可以在没有梯子的情况下得到正确的 8.8.8.8 对任意域名的解析结果。所以，如果你使用本程序，请记得将 dns 修改为 8.8.8.8。
 
How It Works
 
本节大致说明工作原理。
 
GFW 污染 DNS 的方式为抢答，我们只需要丢弃投毒响应即可获得正确的解析结果。通过 eBPF 我们可以在内核中插入代码，相比在用户态启动代理，这样可以获得更好的性能。
 
要丢弃投毒响应，重点是找到它们的特征。
 
以 twitter.com 为例，当向 8.8.8.8 请求 twitter.com 的 A 记录时，正常的响应会返回 2 条结果（1Q2A）；而 GFW 只会返回 1 条，但是使用了 2 次抢答。2 次抢答包其中一个 IP Id…</span>

                    <span>Firefox privacy, security and anti-fingerprinting: a comprehensive user.js template for configuration and hardening

🟪 user.js
 
A user.js is a configuration file that can control hundreds of Firefox settings. For a more technical breakdown and explanation, you can read more on the overview wiki page.
 
🟩 the arkenfox user.js
 

 
The arkenfox user.js is a template which aims to provide as much privacy and enhanced security as possible, and to reduce tracking and fingerprinting as much as possible - while minimizing any loss of functionality and breakage (but it will happen).
 
Everyone, experts included, should at least read the implementation wiki page, as it contains important information regarding a few user.js settings.
 
Note that we do not recommend connecting over Tor on Firefox. Use the Tor Browser if your threat model calls for it, or for accessing hidden services.
 
Also be aware that the arkenfox user.js is made specifically for desktop Firefox. Using it as-is in other Gecko-based browsers can be counterproductive, especially in the Tor Browser.

Twenty Twenty-Two
 
Welcome to the development repository for the default theme that will launch with WordPress 5.9.
 
 
About
 
Twenty Twenty-Two is designed to be the most flexible default theme ever created for WordPress. It&#x27;s built for full site editing first as a block theme. The theme aims to ship with as little CSS as possible: our goal is for all theme styles to be configured through theme.json and editable through Global Styles. The theme development team will work closely with Gutenberg contributors to build design tools in the block editor that enable this goal.

General Information
 
Wireshark is a network traffic analyzer, or &quot;sniffer&quot;, for Linux, macOS, *BSD and other Unix and Unix-like operating systems and for Windows. It uses Qt, a graphical user interface library, and libpcap and npcap as packet capture and filtering libraries.
 
The Wireshark distribution also comes with TShark, which is a line-oriented sniffer (similar to Sun&#x27;s snoop or tcpdump) that uses the same dissection, capture-file reading and writing, and packet filtering code as Wireshark, and with editcap, which is a program to read capture files and write the packets from that capture fil…</span>

Writing a &quot;bare metal&quot; operating system for Raspberry Pi 4
 
Introduction
 
As a tech CEO @RealVNC, I don&#x27;t write code any more. And I&#x27;ve recently realised just how much I miss it.
 
Currently in the throes of a nationwide &quot;lockdown&quot; due to Covid-19 (and having been spared my usual commute), I&#x27;ve found myself with more hours in the day. I have taken this time for myself and used it to fulfil a childhood ambition - to write a bare metal operating system that runs on commercial hardware.
 
What does bare metal mean?
 
When we buy a computer or a tablet/smartphone it typically comes with some basic software pre-installed. You&#x27;ll likely be familiar with watching Microsoft Windows, Mac OS, iOS, Android or maybe even Linux sta…</span>

The Uncompromising Code Formatter
 
          
 
 
 
“Any color you like.”
 
 
Black is the uncompromising Python code formatter. By using it, you agree to cede control over minutiae of hand-formatting. In return, Black gives you speed, determinism, and freedom from pycodestyle nagging about formatting. You will save time and mental energy for more important matters.
 
Blackened code looks the same regardless of the project you&#x27;re reading. Formatting becomes transparent after a while and you can focus on the content instead.
 
Black makes code review faster by producing the smallest diffs possible.
 
Try it out now using the Black Playground. Watch the PyCon 2019 talk to learn more.

Hiring Without Whiteboards
 
A list of companies (or teams) that don&#x27;t do &quot;whiteboard&quot; interviews. &quot;Whiteboards&quot; is used as a metaphor, and is a symbol for the kinds of CS trivia questions that are associated with bad interview practices. Whiteboards are not bad – CS trivia questions are. Using sites like HackerRank/LeetCode probably fall into a similar category.
 
The companies and teams listed here use interview techniques and questions that resemble day-to-day work. For example, pairing on a real world problem or a paid/unpaid take home exercise. Read (and contribute to) our recommendations for ways to conduct better interviews.

Discussing a real world problem (with or without whiteboard) is 👍

Hello, world! 👋
 
We&#x27;ve rebuilt data engineering for the data science era.
 
Prefect is a new workflow management system, designed for modern infrastructure and powered by the open-source Prefect Core workflow engine. Users organize Tasks into Flows, and Prefect takes care of the rest.
 
Read the docs; get the code; ask us anything!
 
Welcome to Workflows
 
Prefect&#x27;s Pythonic API should feel familiar for newcomers. Mark functions as tasks and call them on each other to build up a flow.

@task(log_stdout&#x3D;True)

Warning: This project is in early stages of development, the final product may differ from what you see now.
 
NanaZip is an open source file archiver intended for the modern Windows experience, forked from the source code of well-known open source file archiver 7-Zip 21.03.
 
We need help to translate NanaZip into native languages that have not been supported.
 
Known issues
 
 
 
You may meet the application crash in some cases in NanaZip 1.0 Preview 1 because there are some issues in the exception handler implementation from VC-LTL 5.x. I need to wait mingkuang (the author of VC-LTL) to fix it.

                    <span>An easy to use systems programming language with Python-like syntax.
 
Peregrine
 
Peregrine is a compiled programming language currently under development. Docs coming soon.
 

 
Why am I creating this language?
 
I am creating it as a fast alternative to Python and an easy one to C.
 

 
Goals
 
 
 
Ease of use
 
 
Fast
 
 
Highly modular
 
 
Occupies less memory
 
 
Compiled
 
 

 
How does it work?
 
You can consider it to be a superset of C which compiles to clean C. So valid c code is also valid Peregrine code (the language is named Peregrine). It will have no garbage collector because it is a system programming language but it will be very easy to use so there will be less chance of memory leak.
 

 
Requirements to build from source
 
 
 
Gcc compiler
 
 
V compiler
 
 
Build instruction
 
 
 
Clone this repository using the following command -&gt; git clone https://github.com/Peregrine-lang/Peregrine.git
 
 
Run cd Peregrine/Peregrine
 
 
To build it run v peregrine.v
 
 
That&#x27;s it
 
 

 
Primary implementation language
 
For now it is written in V but in the future it will be self hosted.
 

 
Progress
 
Currently we are working on the codegen and some Peregrine programs are working :)
 

 
Example
 
Here is a small example for you to understand:
 
def main():
    print(&quot;hi&quot;)

 
The main function is the entry point for the program.

Goals
 
Syncthing is a continuous file synchronization program. It synchronizes files between two or more computers. We strive to fulfill the goals below. The goals are listed in order of importance, the most important one being the first. This is the summary version of the goal list - for more commentary, see the full Goals document.
 
Syncthing should be:
 
 
 
 Safe From Data Loss
 Protecting the user&#x27;s data is paramount. We take every reasonable precaution to avoid corrupting the user&#x27;s files.
  
 
 Secure Against Attackers
 Again, protecting the user&#x27;s data is paramount. Regardless of our other goals we must never allow the user&#x27;s data to be susceptible to eavesdropping or modification by unauthorized parties.

AWS Cloud Development Kit (AWS CDK)
 
       
 
The AWS Cloud Development Kit (AWS CDK) is an open-source software development framework to define cloud infrastructure in code and provision it through AWS CloudFormation.
 
It offers a high-level object-oriented abstraction to define AWS resources imperatively using the power of modern programming languages. Using the CDK’s library of infrastructure constructs, you can easily encapsulate AWS best practices in your infrastructure definition and share it without worrying about boilerplate logic.
 
The CDK is available in the following languages:
 
 
 
JavaScript, TypeScript (Node.js ≥ 10.13.0)

Companion Jupyter notebooks for the book &quot;Deep Learning with Python&quot;
 
This repository contains Jupyter notebooks implementing the code samples found in the book Deep Learning with Python, 2nd Edition (Manning Publications).
 
For readability, these notebooks only contain runnable code blocks and section titles, and omit everything else in the book: text paragraphs, figures, and pseudocode. If you want to be able to follow what&#x27;s going on, I recommend reading the notebooks side by side with your copy of the book.
 
These notebooks use TensorFlow 2.6.

Reverse Engineer&#x27;s Toolkit
 
What?
 
This is a collection of tools you may like if you are interested on reverse engineering and/or malware analysis on x86 and x64 Windows systems. After installing this program, you&#x27;ll have to ways to access the tools:
 
 
 
Double-click the retoolkit icon in the Desktop.
 
 
Right-click on a file, choose Send to -&gt; retoolkit. This way the selected file is passed as argument to the desired program.
 
 

 
Why do I need it?
 
You don&#x27;t. Obviously, you can download such tools from their own website and install them by yourself in a new VM. But if you download retoolkit, it can probably save you some time. Additionally, the tools come pre-configured so you&#x27;ll find things like x64dbg with a few plugins, c…</span>

What NightDriverStrip is
 
NightDriverStrip is a source code package for building a flash program that you upload to the ESP32 microcontroller. It can drive up to 8 channels of WS2812B style LEDs connected to the chip pins and display fancy colors and patterns and designs on them. There are numerous effects built in that can be configured to be shown on the LED strip, including audio/music/beat-reactive effects for modules equipped with a microphone. It can also optionally receive color data for the LEDs in a simple LZ-compressed (or noncompressed) format over a …</span>

校招污点公司记录
 
本账号及仓库专用于记录在校园招聘中的具有污点行为的公司。
 
污点行为包括但不限于：毁意向书、毁两方协定、毁三方协定、试用期裁员、大量裁应届生。
 
污点行为不包括：毁OC（除非大量）、试用期结束未通过（除非大批量蓄意）。
 
本人是2021届应届毕业生，参加了2021届的秋招，看到了好多往年公司毁约却在第二年依旧简历爆满的情况。本仓库的设立旨在帮助正在进行校招或者即将参加校招的同学们提供一个参考以避雷，并不是说这些公司就再也不能投了，但是具有污点的公司仍然要被钉在校招的耻辱柱上，让他们知道所谓的弱势群体也不是一盘散沙。
 
本仓库的主要信息来自于牛客等公开论坛（很多帖子都会被当场公关，但是互联网不会忘记，对于被删除的帖子，我会尽量提供快照），欢迎大家积极补充参与。

AI4Animation: Deep Learning for Character Control
 
This project explores the opportunities of deep learning for character animation and control as part of my Ph.D. research at the University of Edinburgh in the School of Informatics, supervised by Taku Komura. Over the last couple years, this project has become a comprehensive framework for data-driven character animation, including data processing, network training and runtime control, developed in Unity3D / Tensorflow / PyTorch. This repository demonstrates using neural networks for animating biped locomotion, quadruped locomotion, and character-scene interactions with objects and the environment, plus sports and fighting games.

The tldr-pages project is a collection of community-maintained help pages for command-line tools, that aims to be a simpler, more approachable complement to traditional man pages.
 
Maybe you are new to the command-line world? Or just a little rusty? Or perhaps you can&#x27;t always remember the arguments to lsof, or tar?
 
It certainly doesn&#x27;t help that the first option explained in man tar is:
 
-b blocksize
   Specify the block size, in 512-byte records, for tape drive I/O.
   As a rule, this argument is only needed when reading from or writing to tape drives,
   and usually not even then as the default block size of 20 records (10240 bytes) is very common.

Introduction
 
React is a great tool for building frontend applications. It has a very diverse ecosystem with hundreds of great libraries for literally anything you might need. However, it can be overwhelming to be forced to make so many choices. It is also very flexible, you can write React applications in any way you like but that flexibility comes with a cost. Since there is no pre-defined architecture developers can follow, it often leads to messy, inconsistent, or over-complicated codebases.
 
This is an attempt to present a way of creating React applicati…</span>

Introduction
 
weggli is a fast and robust semantic search tool for C and C++ codebases. It is designed to help security researchers identify interesting functionality in large codebases.
 
weggli performs pattern matching on Abstract Syntax Trees based on user provided queries. Its query language resembles C and C++ code, making it easy to turn interesting code patterns into queries.
 
weggli is inspired by great tools like Semgrep, Coccinelle, joern and CodeQL, but makes some different design decisions:
 
 
 
 C++ support: weggli has first class support for modern C++ constructs, such as lambda expression…</span>

SerenityOS
 
Graphical Unix-like operating system for x86 computers.
 
    
 
About
 
SerenityOS is a love letter to &#x27;90s user interfaces with a custom Unix-like core. It flatters with sincerity by stealing beautiful ideas from various other systems.
 
Roughly speaking, the goal is a marriage between the aesthetic of late-1990s productivity software and the power-user accessibility of late-2000s *nix. This is a system by us, for us, based on the things we like.
 
I (Andreas) regularly post raw hacking sessions and demos on my YouTube channel.
 
Sometimes I write about the system on my github.io blog.
 
I&#x27;m also on Patreon and GitHub Sponsors if you would like to show some support that way.

GitOops is a tool to help attackers and defenders identify lateral movement and privilege escalation paths in GitHub organizations by abusing CI/CD pipelines and GitHub access controls.
 
It works by mapping relationships between a GitHub organization and its CI/CD jobs and environment variables. It&#x27;ll use any Bolt-compatible graph database as backend, so you can query your attack paths with openCypher:
 
MATCH p&#x3D;(:User{login:&quot;alice&quot;})-[*..5]-&gt;(v:EnvironmentVariable)
WHERE v.name &#x3D;~ &quot;.*SECRET.*&quot;
RETURN p

 
 
 
  
 
 
GitOops takes inspiration from tools like Bloodhound and Cartography.

It&#x27;s an initiative by Twowaits Technologies to help create more awareness about Open Source and help introduce many more students to the benefits of FOSS. We will organize lots of events that will prove to be very profitable for the students and encourage them to contribute in open source, this is our humble step.
 
Lots of students struggle in creating their first PR. They try somewhat and leave when couldn&#x27;t. We created this as learning repo on how to create successful pull requests on languages like JAVA, Python, C++, HTML/CSS.

                    <span>A Zanzibar-inspired database that stores, computes, and validates application permissions

SpiceDB
 
      
 
SpiceDB is a Zanzibar-inspired database that stores, computes, and validates application permissions.
 
Developers create a schema that models their permissions requirements and use a client library to apply the schema to the database, insert data into the database, and query the data to efficiently check permissions in their applications.
 
Features that distinguish SpiceDB from other systems include:
 
 
 
Expressive APIs for checking permissions, listing access, and powering devtools
 
 
An architecture faithful to the Google Zanzibar paper, including resistance to the New Enemy Problem
 
 
An intuitive and expressive schema language complete with a playground dev environment
