A simple, scalable, and powerful architecture for building production ready React applications.
 
Introduction
 
React is a great tool for building frontend applications. It has a very diverse ecosystem with hundreds of great libraries for literally anything you might need. However, it can be overwhelming to be forced to make so many choices. It is also very flexible, you can write React applications in any way you like but that flexibility comes with a cost. Since there is no pre-defined architecture developers can follow, it often leads to messy, inconsistent, or over-complicated codebases.
 
This is an attempt to present a way of creating React applicati…</span>

About Laravel
 
 
 
Note: This repository contains the core code of the Laravel framework. If you want to build an application using Laravel, visit the main Laravel repository.
 
 
Laravel is a web application framework with expressive, elegant syntax. We believe development must be an enjoyable, creative experience to be truly fulfilling. Laravel attempts to take the pain out of development by easing common tasks used in the majority of web projects, such as:
 
 
 
Simple, fast routing engine.
 
 
Powerful dependency injection container.
 
 
Multiple back-ends for session and cache storage.
 
 
Database agnostic schema migrations.
 
 
Robust background job processing.
 
 
Real-time event broadcasting.
 
 
Laravel is accessible, yet powerful, providing tools needed for large, robust applications. A superb combination of simplicity, elegance, and innovation gives you a complete toolset required to build any application with which you are tasked.

An open-source online reverse dictionary 
 
What Is a Reverse Dictionary?
 
Opposite to a regular (forward) dictionary that provides definitions for query words, a reverse dictionary returns words semantically matching the query descriptions.
 
 
What Can a Reverse Dictionary Do?
 
 
 
Solve the tip-of-the-tongue problem, the phenomenon of failing to retrieve a word from memory
 
 
Help new language learners
 
 
Help word selection (or word dictionary) anomia patients, people who can recognize and describe an object but fail to name it due to neurological disorder

Android 工程师进阶手册（8 年 Android 开发者的成长感悟）
 
2021 年是我做 Android 开发的第 8 年了，随着工作的不断深入，我越来越发现对于多数工程师来说，除了把技术能力搞好之外，更需要学习如何沟通，如何思考以及如何在职场中协调资源。这些能力反而更决定了一个工程师发展的上限。为此我写了这本小册子，这里我把 Android 开发的进阶分为了三个阶段，初级，中级和高级。这只是为了让读者更容易找到开始阅读的章节。在进行阅读之前，你可以先过一下整体的目录，如果你对某个阶段的内容早已了然于心，那么可以跳过这个阶段阅读。如果整本手册都没有感兴趣的话题，当然也就不必再看下去了。
 
如果你有任何想法或者问题，可以通过提 issue 的方式跟我交流，同时也欢迎关注我的公众号：SkyKai ，期待你的交流！
 
第一部分、初级工程师进阶
 
初级工程师的首要任务是提高工作能力，努力向中高级工程师进阶。这个过程艰难且漫长，需要一步一个脚印的往上走，最终才能成为高级工程师。 第一个脚印就是成为能出色完成上级布置的任务，能独立排查问题，态度积极，乐于迎接挑战的工程师。 我给优秀初级工程师的定义为：“又快又好”，其中“快”指需求完成的速度快，问题响应的速度快，问题解决的速度快等等。而“好”指代码编写的质量好，工作态度好，任务完成度好等等。 接下来我将从认知篇，知识篇与职场篇，来聊聊初级工程师如何进阶。
 
认知篇
 
 
 
1.1 遇到问题应该怎么办？
 
 
1.2 优秀工程师离不开 GitHub
 
 
1.3 反编译不是高级技巧
 
 
1.4 学会调试
 
 
1.5 对自己的代码负责
 
 
知识篇
 
 
 
2.1 Activity 与 Fragment
 
 
2.2 Handler 消息机制
 
 
2.3 理解 View 体系
 
 
2.4 自定义 View
 
 
2.5 动画机制
 
 
2.6 线程与进程
 
 
职场篇
 
 
 
3.1 职场注意事项
 
 
3.2 需求开发的完整流程
 
 
3.3 什么时候跳槽？
 
 
3.4 要努力进大厂吗？
 
 
3.5 如何准备面试？
 
 
3.6 如何选择 Offer ？
 
 
第二部分、中级工程师进阶
 
初级工程师只要又快又好的完成任务就可以，中级工程师阶段不仅要又快又好，还要能独当一面。独当一面是要能独立负责一个项目，或者一个独立业务。并在遇到问题时可以独立解决，成为最熟悉自己负责业务的那个人。 中级工程师开始要注重代码规范，学习更底层的知识，一般还要指导初级工程师。同时要懂得更多职场规则，并做好长远的职业规划。
 
认知篇
 
 
 
4.1 如何引入开源项目
 
 
4.2 如何快速排查问题
 
 
4.3 怎样写出漂亮的代码
 
 
4.4 怎样写好注释
 
 
4.5 代码出 Bug 该怎么办？
 
 
4.6 怎样才能少出 Bug ？
 
 
4.7 业务开发与架构开发
 
 
知识篇
 
 
 
5.1 进程间通信
 
 
5.2 热修复技术
 
 
5.3 常用设计模式
 
 
5.4 常用架构模式
 
 
5.5 如何优化应用启动性能
 
 
5.6 经典开源项目解析
 
 
职场篇
 
 
 
6.1 职场沟通技巧
 
 
6.2 做好一个需求的要点
 
 
6.3 做好长期规划
 
 
6.4 要不要拒绝 996 ？
 
 
第三部分、高级工程师进阶
 
高级工程师阶段，无论是编程能力还是业务能力，你都具有了一些不可替代性。你通常负责新技术的预研，重要需求推进以及新项目的技术选型。高级工程师会让老板和同事觉得：非你不可。你更多的时间是在解决别人解决不了的事情，尝试业界还未尝试过的方案以及帮助其他工程师成长。 到了这个阶段编程语言已经不重要了，一切选择都为了业务更好的发展。同时也要考虑更多代码之外的事情了。
 
认知篇
 
 
 
7.1 高级工程师的特点
 
 
7.2 参与开源项目
 
 
7.3 如何判断技术发展趋势

欢迎来到Lean的Openwrt源码仓库！
 
English
 
如何编译自己需要的 OpenWrt 固件
 
注意：
 
 
 
不要用 root 用户进行编译！！！
 
 
国内用户编译前最好准备好梯子
 
 
默认登陆IP 192.168.1.1 密码 password
 
 
编译命令如下:
 
 
 
 首先装好 Ubuntu 64bit，推荐 Ubuntu 20.04 LTS x64
  
 
 命令行输入 sudo apt-get update ，然后输入 sudo apt-get -y install build-essential asciidoc binutils bzip2 gawk gettext git libncurses5-dev libz-dev patch python3 python2.7 unzip zlib1g-dev lib32gcc1 libc6-dev-i386 subversion flex uglifyjs git-core gcc-multilib p7zip p7zip-full msmtp libssl-dev texinfo libglib2.0-dev xmlto qemu-utils upx libelf-dev autoconf automake libtool autopoint device-tree-compiler g++-multilib antlr3 gperf wget curl swig rsync
  
 
 使用 git clone https://github.com/coolsnowwolf/lede 命令下载好源代码，然后 cd lede 进入目录
  
 
 ./scripts/feeds update -a
./scripts/feeds install -a
make menuconfig

  
 
 make -j8 download V&#x3D;s 下载dl库（国内请尽量全局科学上网）
  
 
 输入 make -j1 V&#x3D;s （-j1 后面是线程数。第一次编译推荐用单线程）即可开始编译你要的固件了。
  
 
本套代码保证肯定可以编译成功。里面包括了 R21 所有源代码，包括 IPK 的。
 
你可以自由使用，但源码编译二次发布请注明我的 GitHub 仓库链接。谢谢合作！
 
二次编译：
 
cd lede
git pull
./scripts/feeds update -a &amp;&amp; ./scripts/feeds install -a
make defconfig
make -j8 download
make -j$(($(nproc) + 1)) V&#x3D;s

 
如果需要重新配置：
 
rm -rf ./tmp &amp;&amp; rm -rf .config
make menuconfig
make -j$(($(nproc) + 1)) V&#x3D;s

 
编译完成后输出路径：bin/targets
 
如果你使用WSL或WSL2进行编译：
 
由于wsl的PATH路径中包含带有空格的Windows路径，有可能会导致编译失败，请在将make -j1 V&#x3D;s或make -j$(($(nproc) + 1)) V&#x3D;s改为
 
首次编译：
 
PATH&#x3D;/usr/local/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/bin:/sbin:/bin make -j1 V&#x3D;s 

 
二次编译：
 
PATH&#x3D;/usr/local/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/bin:/sbin:/bin make -j$(($(nproc) + 1)) V&#x3D;s

 
特别提示：
 
 
 
 源代码中绝不含任何后门和可以监控或者劫持你的 HTTPS 的闭源软件， SSL 安全是互联网最后的壁垒。安全干净才是固件应该做到的；

Manim is an engine for precise programmatic animations, designed for creating explanatory math videos.
 
Note, there are two versions of manim. This repository began as a personal project by the author of 3Blue1Brown for the purpose of animating those videos, with video-specific code available here. In 2020 a group of developers forked it into what is now the community edition, with a goal of being more stable, better tested, quicker to respond to community contributions, and all around friendlier to get started with. See this page for more details.

                    <span>Yet another redundant workflow engine

redun
 
yet another redundant workflow engine
 
redun aims to be a more expressive and efficient workflow framework, built on top of the popular Python programming language. It takes the somewhat contrarian view that writing dataflows directly is unnecessarily restrictive, and by doing so we lose abstractions we have come to rely on in most modern high-level languages (control flow, compositiblity, recursion, high order functions, etc). redun&#x27;s key insight is that workflows can be expressed as lazy expressions, that are then evaluated by a scheduler which performs automatic parallelization, caching, and data provenance logging.
 
redun&#x27;s key features are:
 
 
 
Workflows are defined by lazy expressions that when evaluated emit dynamic directed acyclic…</span>

JAVA解析Excel工具EasyExcel
 
Java解析、生成Excel比较有名的框架有Apache poi、jxl。但他们都存在一个严重的问题就是非常的耗内存，poi有一套SAX模式的API可以一定程度的解决一些内存溢出的问题，但POI还是有一些缺陷，比如07版Excel解压缩以及解压后存储都是在内存中完成的，内存消耗依然很大。easyexcel重写了poi对07版Excel的解析，一个3M的excel用POI sax解析依然需要100M左右内存，改用easyexcel可以降低到几M，并且再大的excel也不会出现内存溢出；03版依赖POI的sax模式，在上层做了模型转换的封装，让使用者更加简单方便
 
64M内存20秒读取75M(46W行25列)的Excel（3.0.2+版本）
 
当然还有极速模式能更快，但是内存占用会在100M多一点 
 
版本支持
 
 
 
2+ 版本支持 Java7和Java6
 
 
3+ 版本至少 Java8
 
 
关于版本升级
 
 
 
不建议跨大版本升级 尤其跨2个大版本

Microsoft Power Fx
 

 
Microsoft Power Fx is a low-code general purpose programming language based on spreadsheet-like formulas. It is a strongly typed, declarative, and functional language, with imperative logic and state management available as needed.
 
Power Fx started with Power Apps canvas apps and that is where you can experience it now. We are in the process of extracting the language from that product so that we can use it in more Microsoft Power Platform products and make it available here for you to use. That&#x27;s going to take some time and we will report on our progress here and on the Power Apps blog.

Преамбула
 
Необходимо исправить все недостатки линукса и сделать самый лучший и самый доступный дистрибутив из всех существующих, чтобы любой человек на планете мог получать удовольствие от использования этой операционной системы. Эту концепцию я решил назвать Линуксом нового поколения.
 
Кто я такой вообще?
 
Я Линус Торвальдс.
 
Это не троллинг, говорю абсолютно серьёзно. Я решил стать Линусом Торвальдсом. Внезапно осознал, что я и есть Линус Торвальдс и был им всю жизнь. Я посмотрел на ядро линукса и оно меня освободило. И я понял, что пора. Пора наконец то сделать свой собственный дистрибутив - идеальный, лучший, единственный.
 
Цель
 
С установкой софта на моей оси должна справится любая домохозяйка

News: We released the codebase v0.17.2.
 
In addition, we have preliminarily supported several new models on the v1.0.0.dev0 branch, including DGCNN, SMOKE and PGD.
 
Note: We are going through large refactoring to provide simpler and more unified usage of many modules. Thus, few features will be added to the master branch in the following months.
 
The compatibilities of models are broken due to the unification and simplification of coordinate systems. For now, most models are benchmarked with similar performance, though few models are still being benchmarked.
 
You can start experiments with v1.0.0.dev0 if you are interested. Please note that our new features will only be supported in v1.0.0 branch afterw…</span>

Recently, there has been a massive infestation of spam on YouTube where fake impersonator accounts leave spam/scam replies to hundreds of users on a creator&#x27;s videos. For some god-forsaken reason, YouTube offers no way to delete all comments by a specific user at once, meaning you must delete them one by one BY HAND.

青龙，又名苍龙，在中国传统文化中是四象之一、天之四灵之一，根据五行学说，它是代表东方的灵兽，为青色的龙，五行属木，代表的季节是春季，八卦主震。苍龙与应龙一样，都是身具羽翼。《张果星宗》称“又有辅翼，方为真龙”。
 
《后汉书·律历志下》记载：日周于天，一寒一暑，四时备成，万物毕改，摄提迁次，青龙移辰，谓之岁。
 
在中国二十八宿中，青龙是东方七宿（角、亢、氐、房、心、尾、箕）的总称。 在早期星宿信仰中，祂是最尊贵的天神。 但被道教信仰吸纳入其神系后，神格大跌，道教将其称为“孟章”，在不同的道经中有“帝君”、“圣将”、“神将”和“捕鬼将”等称呼，与白虎监兵神君一起，是道教的护卫天神。

Luau  
 
Luau (lowercase u, /ˈlu.aʊ/) is a fast, small, safe, gradually typed embeddable scripting language derived from Lua.
 
It is designed to be backwards compatible with Lua 5.1, as well as incorporating some features from future Lua releases, but also expands the feature set (most notably with type annotations). Luau is largely implemented from scratch, with the language runtime being a very heavily modified version of Lua 5.1 runtime, with completely rewritten interpreter and other performance innovations. The runtime mostly preserves Lua 5.1 API, so existing bindings should be more or less compatible with a few caveats.
 
Luau is used by Roblox game developers to write game code, as well as by Robl…</span>

Container App Store Microservice Sample
 
This is a sample microservice solution for Azure Container Apps. It will create a store microservice which will need to call into an order service and an inventory service. Dapr is used to secure communication and calls between services, and Azure API Management and Azure Cosmos DB are created alongside the microservices.
 
The entire solution is configured with GitHub Actions and Bicep for CI/CD.
 
IMPORTANT: In general, each microservice should have an independent release and deployment. For the sake of this sample we are building and deploying as part of a single repo.

Toxiproxy
 
 
 

 
Toxiproxy is a framework for simulating network conditions. It&#x27;s made specifically to work in testing, CI and development environments, supporting deterministic tampering with connections, but with support for randomized chaos and customization. Toxiproxy is the tool you need to prove with tests that your application doesn&#x27;t have single points of failure. We&#x27;ve been successfully using it in all development and test environments at Shopify since October, 2014. See our blog post on resiliency for more information.

Front-end Developer Interview Questions
 
This repository contains a number of front-end interview questions that can be used when vetting potential candidates. It is by no means recommended to use every single question here on the same candidate (that would take hours). Choosing a few items from this list should help you vet the intended skills you require.
 
Note: Keep in mind that many of these questions are open-ended and could lead to interesting discussions that tell you more about the person&#x27;s capabilities than a straight answer would.

                    <span>A truly Open Source MongoDB alternative

MangoDB
 
MangoDB is set out to become the de-facto open-source alternative to MongoDB. MangoDB is an open-source proxy, which converts MongoDB wire protocol queries to SQL, and uses PostgreSQL as a database engine.
 
Why do we need MangoDB?
 
MongoDB is a life-changing technology for many developers, empowering them to build applications faster than using relational databases. Its easy-to-use and well-documented drivers make MongoDB one of the easiest to use database solutions available. However, MongoDB abandoned its open-source roots, changing the license to SSPL - making it unusable for many open source and commercial projects.
 
Most MongoDB users are not in need of many of the advanced features offered by MongoDB; however, they are in need of …</span>

This project is part of my personal development plan at Agile Actors. My aim is to use technologies and practices that I am not familiar with in order to build an e-commerce site and futher develop my professional skills.
 
One of the major aims of this project is to set up the toolchain from the scratch, in order to familiarise myself with the whole process of creating an application, rather than writing code on top of a pre-configured development environment.

                    <span>教科书《计算机体系结构基础》（胡伟武等，第三版）的开源版本

计算机体系结构基础
 
这是龙芯团队胡伟武老师等人编写的《计算机体系结构基础》（第三版）的开源版本。本书纸质版本由机械工业出版社发行，前两版可以通过各种常规渠道购买，第三版纸质版本也即将发行。
 
内容提要
 
本书由从事微处理器设计的一线科研人员编写而成。作者从微处理器设计的角度出发，充分考虑计算机体系结构的学科完整性，强调体系结构、基础软件、电路和器件的融会贯通。全书共分12章，包括指令系统结构、计算机硬件结构、CPU微结构、并行处理结构、计算机性能分析等主要内容，重点放在作为软硬件界面的指令系统结构，以及包含CPU、GPU、南北桥协同的计算机硬件结构。本书可作为高等学校“计算机体系结构”课程的本科生教材，同时也适合相关专业研究生或计算机技术人员参考阅读。
 
关于本书内容更多的介绍可以参考推荐序、自序、第三版序和前言等相关章节。
 
关于本书的开源维护
 
在第三版的改版过程中，作者们引入了一个创新尝试，试图将本书打造为一本活的教科书。具体来说，我们采用以文本为基础的rmarkdown格式编辑书本内容（采用bookdown工具包），用git对其进行版本管理，并在互联网进行开源维护。在相应的网站上，还会提供出版社提供的与纸质版本一致的电子版本，以及相关的参考课件PPT和其他补充资源。我们认为这么做有几个好处：
 
 
 
文字、图片和参考课件等素材的开放更方便教学使用。通过开源本书，我们期望能够它得到更广泛的采用，得到更多的批评指正意见，使得它能够更快成熟。
 
 
方便的版本管理系统有助于及时吸收对本书的勘误和改进。一方面，读者可以通过项目的问题管理系统或者其他渠道反馈问题，被接纳后会立即反映到在线的版本中，不必等待下一次改版印刷周期。另一方面，作者们也可以将之前对由于时间仓促未来得及完善的内容进行补充完善…</span>

Swift Markdown
 
Swift Markdown is a Swift package for parsing, building, editing, and analyzing Markdown documents.
 
The parser is powered by GitHub-flavored Markdown&#x27;s cmark-gfm implementation, so it follows the spec closely. As the needs of the community change, the effective dialect implemented by this library may change.
 
The markup tree provided by this package is comprised of immutable/persistent, thread-safe, copy-on-write value types that only copy substructure that has changed. Other examples of the main strategy behind this library can be seen in Swift&#x27;s lib/Syntax and its Swift bindings, SwiftSyntax.

Baileys does not require Selenium or any other browser to be interface with WhatsApp Web, it does so directly using a WebSocket. Not running Selenium or Chromimum saves you like half a gig of ram :/
 
Thank you to @Sigalor for writing his observations on the workings of WhatsApp Web and thanks to @Rhymen for the go implementation.
 
Baileys is type-safe, extensible and simple to use. If you require more functionality than provided, it&#x27;ll super easy for you to write an extension. More on this here.

PatrickStar: Parallel Training of Large Language Models via a Chunk-based Memory Management
 

 
Meeting PatrickStar
 
Pre-Trained Models (PTM) are becoming the hotspot of both NLP research and industry application. They are models that are trained with massive data and have learned generic features of the language. In pactice, they are fine-tuned for downstream tasks with task-specific datasets. In this way, PTMs have achieved great performances in almost every tasks. However, the training of PTMs requires enormous hardware resources, which makes it only accessible to small portion of people in the AI community. Now, PatrickStar will make PTM training available to everyone!

 Darius Rückert, Linus Franke, Marc Stamminger
 

 
Abstract: We present a novel point-based, differentiable neural rendering pipeline for scene refinement and novel view synthesis. The input are an initial estimate of the point cloud and the camera parameters. The output are synthesized images from arbitrary camera poses. The point cloud rendering is performed by a differentiable renderer using multi-resolution one-pixel point rasterization. Spatial gradients of the discrete rasterization are approximated by the novel concept of ghost geometry. After rendering, the neural image pyramid is passed through a deep neural network for shading calculations and hole-filling. A differentiable, physically-based tonemapper then converts t…</span>

                    <span>Trojan Source: Invisible Vulnerabilities

Trojan Source
 
Trojan Source: Invisible Vulnerabilities
 
Overview
 
We present a new type of attack in which source code is maliciously encoded so that it appears different to a compiler and to the human eye. This attack exploits subtleties in text-encoding standards such as Unicode to produce source code whose tokens are logically encoded in a different order from the one in which they are displayed, leading to vulnerabilities that cannot be perceived directly by human code reviewers.
 
&#x27;Trojan Source&#x27; attacks, as we call them, pose an immediate threat both to first-party software and supply-chain compromise across the industry. We present working examples of Trojan-Source attacks in C, C++, C#, JavaScript, Java, Rust, Go, and Python. We propose definitive compiler-level defenses, and describe other mitigating controls that can be deployed in editors, repositories, and build pipelines while compilers are upgraded to block this attack.
 
Additional details can be found in our related paper and at trojansource.codes.
 
Proofs-of-Concept
 
This repository is divided into per-language subdirectories. Each subdirectory contains a series of proofs-of-concept implementing various Trojan-Source attacks as well as a README describing the compilers/interpreters with which these attacks were verified.

本书的第二版
 
虽然纸质书第一版已经出版，但深度学习领域依然在迅速发展。为了得到来自更广泛的英文开源社区的帮助，从而提升本书质量，本书的第二版正在用英文写。英文版正不断被搬回中文版中。
 
目前，英文版已超过160节（中文版共96节），例如增加了理论背景（如优化收敛分析）、硬件设计（如参数服务器）、全新篇章（如注意力机制、推荐系统、深度学习的数学、生成对抗网络）、应用种类（如自然语言推断）、模型种类（如Transformer、BERT）等，并优化重组了大量章节（如将自然语言处理篇章按从预训练表征、到模型设计、再到下游应用重构）。

 Joplin is a free, open source note taking and to-do application, which can handle a large number of notes organised into notebooks. The notes are searchable, can be copied, tagged and modified either from the applications directly or from your own text editor. The notes are in Markdown format.
 
Notes exported from Evernote via .enex files can be imported into Joplin, including the formatted content (which is converted to Markdown), resources (images, attachments, etc.) and complete metadata (geolocation, updated time, created time, etc.). Plain Markdown files can also be imported.

Zigbee2MQTT 🌉 🐝
 
 
 Allows you to use your Zigbee devices without the vendors bridge or gateway. 
 
 
 It bridges events and allows you to control your Zigbee devices via MQTT. In this way you can integrate your Zigbee devices with whatever smart home infrastructure you are using. 
 
 
Getting started
 
The documentation provides you all the information needed to get up and running! Make sure you don&#x27;t skip sections if this is your first visit, as there might be important details in there for you.
 
If you aren&#x27;t familiar with Zigbee terminology make sure you read this to help you out.

                    <span>Code katas for learning Spring® and Spring Boot.

 
 

 
 
What is the spring-course?
 
 
 
The Spring course consists of two related tutorials that teach developers about Spring Framework and then Spring Boot. The courses lay out examples that are discussed via documentation, located under the assetsdocs directory.
 
 
 
 
The best way to take this course is to checkout the entire project locally, then view:
 
 
 
 
 
  
 Spring Framework Docs: for the Spring Framework tutorial
  
  
 Spring Boot Docs: for a Spring Boot tutorial.
  
 
 
 
 
 
The courses are fairly independent, someone who knows Spring framework well, need only visit the Spring Boot tutorial to get up to speed. However, it is worth hitting a refresher and going through the Spring Framework content (even if solving the exercises is not attempted).

 This is in no way a comprehensive list of all cool features of Spring and Spring Boot, and is meant as a beginner introduction.</span>

Arduino on ESP8266
 
This project brings support for the ESP8266 chip to the Arduino environment. It lets you write sketches, using familiar Arduino functions and libraries, and run them directly on ESP8266, with no external microcontroller required.
 
ESP8266 Arduino core comes with libraries to communicate over WiFi using TCP and UDP, set up HTTP, mDNS, SSDP, and DNS servers, do OTA updates, use a file system in flash memory, and work with SD cards, servos, SPI and I2C peripherals.

The ultimate goal of the Zig project is to serve users. As a first-order effect, this means users of the compiler, helping programmers to write better software. Even more important, however, are the end-users.
 
Zig is intended to be used to help end-users accomplish their goals. Zig should be used to empower end-users, never to exploit them financially, or to limit their freedom to interact with hardware or software in any way.
 
However, such problems are best solved with social norms, not with software licenses. Any attempt to complicate the software license of Zig would risk compromising the value Zig provides.
 
Therefore, Zig is available under the MIT (Expat) License, and comes with a humble request: use it to make software better serve the needs of end-users.
 
This project redistributes code from other projects, some of which have other licenses besides MIT. Such licenses are generally similar to the MIT license for practical purposes. See the subdirectories and files inside lib/ for more details.</span>

Custom 404
 
If /path/to/foo does not exist, we will try:
 
 
 
 /path/to/404.html
  
 
 /path/404.html
  
 
 /404.html
  
 
 return 404 Not Found
  
 
Index Page
 
For /path/to/, we will try:
 
 
 
 /path/to/index.html
  
 
 404.html (/path/to/404.html, /path/404.html, /404.html)

Access /?stop to stop the server.
 
Limitations
 
 
 
 Your browser must support File System Access API and Service Worker API
  
 
 The target website can not use Service Worker API because it is already occupied
  
 
 The target website can only be accessed in the same browser and session
  
 
TODO
 
This is just a toy that took a few hours, and more interesting features will be added later.

With Rust, &quot;If it compiles, it works.&quot; and also, it compiles to many platforms.
 
 
Rust is fast, has no VM, or unnecessary cruft (typically 5-8mb binaries with LOTS of code and libraries).

Repository to store sample Python programs.
 
This repository is meant for beginners to assist them in their learning of Python. The repository covers a wide range of algorithms and other programs, and would prove immensely helpful for everybody interested in Python programming.
 
If this is your first time coding in Python, I would love to suggest you begin from the Basics. They are simple to understand and hopefully will prove fun to you.
 
You can also pay a visit to my very own Youtube channel.
 
Contributions to the repository are welcome.

MiRage Modular Keyboard
 
© 2021 Zack Freedman of Voidstar Lab
 
Licensed Creative Commons 4.0 Attribution Noncommercial Share-Alike
 
The MiRage is a 60% ortholinear keyboard with three clickable OLED displays, intended for Kailh Choc switches and running custom CircuitPython firmware on a Seeedstudio Xiao RP2040.
 
THIS PROJECT IS INCOMPLETE. DO NOT MAKE IT.
 
The PCB can be populated as-is for a &quot;plank&quot; keyboard or broken in half for a split board. The right half can be used independently as the Rage Pad numberpad/macro pad/stream deck.
 
This was designed for a YouTube video on my channel: https://youtu.be/Fg0V5M0llaE It will be improved and sold as a kit, and will form part of a larger project called the Fata Morgana cyberdeck.

This program fixes the missing &quot;Drag &amp; Drop to the Taskbar&quot; support in Windows 11. In the best case, such a simple and basic functionality will return to Windows 11 in October 2022 (or never).

Most Broadcom USB Bluetooth devices make use of a system called RAMUSB. RAMUSB allows the firmware for the device to be updated on-the-fly, however any updates previously applied are lost when shutting down the machine.
 
The Broadcom Windows driver will upload firmware into the Broadcom Bluetooth device on every startup, however for macOS this functionality is not supported out of the box. BrcmPatchRAM kext is a macOS driver which applies PatchRAM updates for Broadcom RAMUSB based devices. It will apply the firmware update to your Broadcom Bluetooth device on every startup / wakeup, identical to the Windows drivers. The firmware applied is extracted from the Windows drivers and the functionality should be equal to Windows.

                    <span>Software Dummy Display Adapter for Apple Silicon Macs to Have Custom HiDPI Resolutions.

BetterDummy
 
Dummy Display for Apple Silicon Macs to achieve custom resolutions.
 
About
 
M1 macs tend to have issues with custom resolutions. Notoriously they don&#x27;t allow sub 4K resolution displays to have HiDPI (&quot;Retina&quot;) resolutions even though for example a 24&quot; QHD display would greatly benefit from having an 1920x1080 HiDPI &quot;Retina&quot; mode.
 
To fix this issue, many resort to buying a 4K HDMI dummy dongle to fool macOS into thinking that a 4K display is connected and then mirror the contents of this dummy display to the physical display in order to have HiDPI resolution. Others use the built in screens of their MacBooks to mirror to the external display. These approaches have obvious drawbacks and…</span>

This repository contains the analysis performed on the leaked forged COVID-19 Certificates. The certificates, contained in string format in the samples/ directory, have been collected from the 4Chan and Raid Forums posts.
 
The results are in the RESULTS.md file and can be generated using ./verify.sh.
 
Please - stay safe and get vaccinated!
 
The situation
 
On 2021-10-27 @emanuelelaface created an issue on ehn-dcc-development/hcert-spec to report a possible private key leakage of French and Polish governments.
 
The issue reports that (online and on Telegram) some forged COVID-19 Certificates are circulating and are still marked as valid.
 
The two certificates mentioned in the post are associated with &quot;Adolf Hitler&quot; with two different dates of birth.

使用
 
PD Runner是一个菜单栏APP, 启动后会在菜单栏显示程序图标. 点击菜单栏图标可列出当前Mac上安装的所有客户机, 然后点击客户机名称即可启动对应的客户机.
 
常见问题
 
1. 什么首次启动会需要输入密码?
 
 
 
因为针对PD 17.1.0新引入的鉴权措施, 需要通过快速切换系统时间来绕过. 所以需要向系统中安装一个特权助理, 方便进行修改时间的操作. 如果不这样做, 那么每次启动虚拟机的时候就都需要输入一次密码.
 
 
2. 为什么PD Runner启动后没有任何窗口?
 
 
 
因为PD Runner是一款菜单栏APP, 启动后只会在菜单栏显示一个图标以供使用, 并没有主窗口.
 
 
3. 虚拟机需要修改为指定的名称才能使用吗?
 
 
 
不需要, PD Runner可以全自动识别当前系统中的客户机, 并自动列出. 不要用户干预.
 
 
4. 安装帮助程序时弹出错误提示怎么办?
 
 
 
如果您看到的错误代码为&quot;Domain&#x3D;CFError DomainLaunchd Code&#x3D;9&quot;, 请尝试在系统的&quot;终端&quot;APP中执行 sudo launchctl enable system/com.lihaoyun6.PD-Runner-Helper
 并输入密码, 然后再次启动PD Runner既可正常使用 (输入密码的过程是不显示密码的, 并不是没有输入进去, 正常输入并回车既可)</span>

Automated cryptocurrency trading bot
 
 
Why?
 
This project was inspired by the observation that all cryptocurrencies pretty much behave in the same way. When one spikes, they all spike, and when one takes a dive, they all do. Pretty much. Moreover, all coins follow Bitcoin&#x27;s lead; the difference is their phase offset.
 
So, if coins are basically oscillating with respect to each other, it seems smart to trade the rising coin for the falling coin, and then trade back when the ratio is reversed.
 
How?
 
The trading is done in the Binance market platform, which of course, does not have markets for every altcoin pair. The workaround for this is to use a bridge currency that will complement missing pairs. The default bridge cu…</span>

waldo-anticheat
 
A project that aims to use optical flow and machine learning to visually detect cheating or hacking in video clips from fps games. Check out this video discussing the purpose and vision of WALDO.
 
Notes
 
 
 
This project is still under development.
 
 
The What
 
A new market for cheats that are visually indistinguishable to the human eye have lead to a rise in &quot;closet hacking&quot; among streamers and professionals. This form of cheating is extremely hard to detect. In some cases it is impossible to detect, even with today&#x27;s most advanced anti-cheat software.
 
We will combat this new kind of cheating by creating our own deep learning program to detect this behavior in video clips.
 
The How
 
Because of the advanced technology used, the only reliable way to detect this form of cheating is by observing the cheating behavior directly from the end result- gameplay. Our goal is to analyze the video directly using deep learning to detect if a user is receiving machine assistance.
 
Phase 1 focuses primarily on humanized aim-assist. Upon completion of phase 1, WALDO&#x27;s main function will be vindication and clarity to many recent &quot;hackusations.&quot;

Leaflet is the leading open-source JavaScript library for mobile-friendly interactive maps. Weighing just about 39 KB of gzipped JS plus 4 KB of gzipped CSS code, it has all the mapping features most developers ever need.
 
Leaflet is designed with simplicity, performance and usability in mind. It works efficiently across all major desktop and mobile platforms out of the box, taking advantage of HTML5 and CSS3 on modern browsers while being accessible on older ones too. It can be extended with a huge amount of plugins, has a beautiful, easy to use and well-documented API and a simple, readable source code that is a joy to contribute to.
 
For more info, docs and tutorials, check out the official website.
 For Leaflet downloads (including the built master version), check out the download page.
 
We&#x27;re happy to meet new contributors. If you want to get involved with Leaflet development, check out the contribution guide. Let&#x27;s make the best mapping library that will ever exist, and push the limits of what&#x27;s possible with online maps!</span>

NixOS System Configurations
 
This repository contains my NixOS system configurations. This repository isn&#x27;t meant to be a turnkey solution to copying my setup or learning Nix, so I want to apologize to anyone trying to look for something &quot;easy&quot;. I&#x27;ve tried to use very simple Nix practices wherever possible, but if you wish to copy from this, you&#x27;ll have to learn the basics of Nix, NixOS, etc.
 
I don&#x27;t claim to be an expert at Nix or NixOS, so there are certainly improvements that could be made! Feel free to suggest them, but please don&#x27;t be offended if I don&#x27;t integrate them, I value having my config work over having it be optimal.

最近更新：2021年10月23日
 
 
 
目前在国内能长期稳定、好用的翻墙VPN很少了，包括不少VPN评论网站也是东抄抄西抄抄，很多过期的内容，部分推荐的在国内并不好用，注意查看下文提醒避免入坑。本文根据实际的使用体验介绍各款翻墙软件VPN近期使用情况，供大家参考和避坑。本文是中国安全翻墙攻略的详细版，讨论翻墙软件、科学上网和网络安全的相关问题，如果只想快速选个科学上网软件来翻墙，直接看下方本文目录导航。
 
 
翻墙（科学上网）重不重要？我想大家都知道，不然也不会看到这篇文章了，翻不了墙就不能Google找程序代码，不能回Gmail邮件，不翻墙就不能看YouTube视频，Udemy买的课程能不能看的舒服？HBO、Netflix能不能追剧？由于工作出差和生活学习需要我经常在国内不同地区翻墙上网，就自己的使用感受和对翻墙软件这个行业的了解，为读者推荐在国内最好用、稳定和安全的科学上网方法和工具，并长期关注VPN、SSR、WireGuard、V2Ray、蓝灯等翻墙和信息安全技术。
 

 
本文作者常年出差，由于生活和工作需要，也为了自己查找资料更加便利，我手机和PC上安装了一共7-8个付费翻墙APP作为常年的备用，担心出差途中不能翻墙和公共网络的安全性，所有我比较关注这类翻墙软件在不同网络环境下的连接稳定性和隐私数据的安全性。根据自己过去2年的测试和使用体验，对几种国内流行的翻墙软件和技术方法做出对比，读者可根据自己的实际情况选择合适的翻墙工具。

XcodeBenchmark contains a large codebase to measure the compilation time in Xcode.
 
You are probably familiar with the following question:
 
 
 
&quot;Should I buy an i5, i7, or even i9 processor for iOS/macOS development?&quot;.
 
 
XcodeBenchmark is initially created for Max Tech YouTube channel to compare the performance of new iMacs 2020.
 
I believe the results will help developers to make the right cost/performance trade-off decision when choosing their next Mac.

Modern PHP Cheatsheet
 

 
 
 
If you like this content, you can ping me or follow me on Twitter 👍
 
 

 
Introduction
 
Motivation
 
This document is a cheatsheet for PHP you will frequently encounter in modern projects and most contemporary sample code.
 
This guide is not intended to teach you PHP from the ground up, but to help developers with basic knowledge who may struggle to get familiar with modern codebases (or let&#x27;s say to learn Laravel or Symfony for instance) because of the new PHP concepts and features introduced over the years.
 
 
 
Note: Concepts introduced here are based on the most recent version of PHP available (PHP 8.0 at the time of the last update)

What is Svelte?
 
Svelte is a new way to build web applications. It&#x27;s a compiler that takes your declarative components and converts them into efficient JavaScript that surgically updates the DOM.
 
Learn more at the Svelte website, or stop by the Discord chatroom.
 
Supporting Svelte
 
Svelte is an MIT-licensed open source project with its ongoing development made possible entirely by fantastic volunteers. If you&#x27;d like to support their efforts, please consider:
 
 
 
Becoming a backer on Open Collective.
 
 
Funds donated via Open Collective will be used for compensating expenses related to Svelte&#x27;s development such as hosting costs. If sufficient donations are received, funds may also be used to support Svelte&#x27;s development more directly.

Fugu14 is an (incomplete) iOS 14 Jailbreak, including an untether (persistence), kernel exploit, kernel PAC bypass and PPL bypass. The CVE numbers of the vulnerabilities are: CVE-2021-30740, CVE-2021-30768, CVE-2021-30769, CVE-2021-30770 and CVE-2021-30773.
 
Supported Devices/iOS Versions
 
Fugu14 should support all arm64e devices (iPhone XS and newer) on iOS 14.3 - 14.5.1.
 Support for lower versions (down to 14.2) can be added by editing arm/shared/ClosurePwn/Sources/ClosurePwn/PwnClosure.swift and arm/shared/KernelExploit/Sources/KernelExploit/offsets.swift.
 
arm64 devices are not supported because the exploit to install the Fugu14 App does not work on these devices.

一个综合了豆瓣，goodreads综合评分的计算机书籍书单
 
介绍
 
整理了豆瓣和goodreads的和计算机，互联网有关的几乎所有书籍，根据不同版本，两个平台的总评价人数和评分求出平均分，按从高到低排列，希望能对寻找经典计算机书籍的朋友提供帮助，排序仅供参考，评分的高低不一定代表书籍的真正质量
 
评分计算
 
 
 
豆瓣的评分为10分制，goodreads评分为5分制，所以在统计的时候会将goodreads的分数乘2来统计，下述表格的分数为10分制
 
 
目前入选的书籍是各版本在两个平台总评价人数&gt;500，后续会再列出&gt;100的一个列表，会有更多新出版/小众的书籍
 
 
书名转向的链接为对应书籍在豆瓣的有评分且比较相对新版本的链接，不一定是最新版，有可能最新版本还没有出评分，或最新版为英文版等，后续会进一步整理
 
 
后续待补充内容
 
数据目前还在简单检查，后续定义好格式后会将下述内容添加到表格：
 
 
 
提供英文版本（正在）
 
 
表格中的每本书可以点击展开折叠，提供每本书不同版本的详细信息，豆瓣和googreads链接，每本的评分等
 
 
提供每本书的相关tag，方便筛选（正在）
 
 
因某些书籍可能由于某一版本的翻译/质量问题会拉低平均分，提供单本书的排行列表
 
 
提供人数大于100的排行
 
 
提供单本(不考虑同一本书的所有其他版次)的排行

GreenPass-Experiments
 
This project was started with the intention of violating the Italian GreenPass which should serve in theory to prevent the spread of COVID-19 but which in my opinion is not very effective. This is because vaccinated people can contract the virus and can be contagious. In addition, the GreenPass limits personal freedom even more with senseless measures that even prevent you from working, for example in schools where all the students, who are used to moving in crowded public transport do not have to show any GreenPass while the teachers who are mostly at a distance behind the desk and they use their private cars must have the GreenPass to work.

Cloud Comparer
 
This is the second version of my Cloud Comparison slide deck which I prepared a year back (can be downloaded here: http://www.slideshare.net/ilyas_it83/microsoft-azure-vs-amazon-web-services-aws-services-feature-mapping). The version 1 recieved more than 22K views and 400+ download at the time of working on this project. This gave me the idea of creating a robust and dependable comparison/mapping between the various services offered by the major cloud providers in a lively and updatable format.
 
The project is open sourced to let fellow Cloud Architects, IT Pros, Developers to feel free to edit and update the comparison upto date.

Abstract
 
Multi-object tracking (MOT) aims at estimating bounding boxes and identities of objects in videos. Most methods obtain identities by associating detection boxes whose scores are higher than a threshold. The objects with low detection scores, e.g. occluded objects, are simply thrown away, which brings non-negligible true object missing and fragmented trajectories. To solve this problem, we present a simple, effective and generic associati…</span>

候选论文
 
考虑在之后视频中将要介绍的论文。选取的原则是10年内深度学习里有影响力文章（必读文章），或者近期比较有意思的文章。当然这十年里重要的工作太多了，不可能一一过一遍。在选取的时候我会偏向一些之前 直播课 中没讲到过的。 欢迎大家在 讨论区 里提供（点）建议（歌）。
 
录一篇文章的时间大概是5个小时（录制、剪辑、上传），这里不算上读文章的时间。我一般是每天深夜找半个小时或者一个小时做一点。如果没有其他更紧要的事情的话，10天左右可以出一篇。如果大家热情 加⭐  话，可以多赶一赶🤣
 
下面列表将会持续更新（数字不代表讲的顺序）。
 
 
 
Adam。深度学习里最常用的优化算法之一。
 
 
EfficientNet。通过架构搜索得到的CNN，现在常被使用。
 
 
BERT。让深度学习在NLP上热度超过了CV。
 
 
GPT3。朝着zero-shot learning迈了一大步。当然也得讲一讲GPT/GPT-2
 
 
GAN。生成类模型中的开创性工作。
 
 
CLIP。图片分类从此不用标数据。
 
 
Non-deep networks。21年10月的新工作，让不深的网络也能在ImageNet刷到SOTA。
 
 
为什么超大的模型泛化性不错

调控降房价是刚需的一厢情愿 
  
 
   
1、人人都有居住权。房子是用来住的，不是用来炒的。
 
   
2、房子太贵了，租售比严重不合理，空置率太高，人均收入太低，早晚要崩盘。
 
   
3、房价上涨造成物价上涨，人民生活变得困难
 
  
  
 
调控的真正目的：防范金融风险 &amp; 通过垄断实现gj利益最大化
 
 
官方公布的统计数据，只要关系到某个群体的利益，就一定会被修饰导致失真
 
 
税收从来都是向下游转嫁的 &amp; 房产税迟迟不出台的真正原因
 
 
房地产的现状
 
 
房价持续上涨的本质是稀缺性让好房子成为资金最好的去处
 
 
关于垄断 
  
 
   
1、垄断的好处是没有风险
 
   
2、垄断可以解决社会稳定
 
   
3、房屋垄断只会愈演愈烈，底层人民想要拥有一套房子的难度只会越来越难

Build
 
To build the necessary binaries, we can just clone the repo, and use the provided Makefile to build the project. This will download the trusted setup params, and compile the source code.
 
$ git clone https://github.com/darkrenaissance/darkfi
$ make

 
Install
 
This will install the binaries and configurations in the configured namespace (/usr/local by default). The configurations are installed as TOML files in /usr/local/share/doc/darkfi. They have to be copied in your user&#x27;s $HOME/.config/darkfi directory. You can review the installed config files, but the defaults should be good for using the testnet if you&#x27;re following this document.

Docker Bench for Security
 

 
The Docker Bench for Security is a script that checks for dozens of common best-practices around deploying Docker containers in production. The tests are all automated, and are based on the CIS Docker Benchmark v1.3.1.
 
We are making this available as an open-source utility so the Docker community can have an easy way to self-assess their hosts and docker containers against this benchmark.
 
Running Docker Bench for Security
 
Run from your base host
 
You can simply run this script from your base host by running:
 
git clone https://github.com/docker/docker-bench-security.git
cd docker-bench-security

ArchTitus Installer Script
 
 
This README contains the steps I do to install and configure a fully-functional Arch Linux installation containing a desktop environment, all the support packages (network, bluetooth, audio, printers, etc.), along with all my preferred applications and utilities. The shell scripts in this repo allow the entire process to be automated.)
 
 
Create Arch ISO or Use Image
 
Download ArchISO from https://archlinux.org/download/ and put on a USB drive with Ventoy or Etcher
 
If you don&#x27;t want to build using this script I did create an image @ https://www.christitus.com/arch-titus
 
Boot Arch ISO
 
From initial Prompt type the following commands:
 
pacman -Sy git
git clone https://github.com/ChrisTitusTech/ArchTitus
cd ArchTitus
./archtitus.sh

 
System Description
 
This is completely automated arch install of the KDE desktop environment on arch using all the packages I use on a daily basis.

Introduction
 
Design patterns are the best formalized practices a programmer can use to solve common problems when designing an application or system.
 
Design patterns can speed up the development process by providing tested, proven development paradigms.
 
Reusing design patterns help prevent subtle issues that cause major problems, and it also improves code readability for coders and architects who are familiar with the patterns.

重要说明
 
 
 
 JD部分较少任务无法判断是等待还是即刻返回，故有些任务需要等待30S自动返回，后续看能不能解决
  
 
 JD的活动界面没办法获得它控件属性那些，这次版本使用的是坐标点击的，可能会有一些问题
  
 
 JDTB如果没办法自动进入做任务界面，请手动进入
  
 
 JD有个别活动是跳过的，比如需要开会员的，比如分享的，还有下单的
  
 
 JD目前有个任务没时间去做，参与城城领钱的，建议手动完成
  
 
 TB要先做好新手教程

Almost all of these live on dockerhub under jess. Because you cannot use notary with autobuilds on dockerhub I also build these continuously on a private registry at r.j3ss.co for public download. (You&#x27;re welcome.)

Building
 
1. Install rustc, cargo and rustfmt.
 
$ curl https://sh.rustup.rs -sSf | sh
$ source $HOME/.cargo/env
$ rustup component add rustfmt

 
When building the master branch, please make sure you are using the latest stable rust version by running:
 
$ rustup update

 
When building a specific release branch, you should check the rust version in ci/rust-version.sh and if necessary, install that version by running:
 
$ rustup install VERSION

 
Note that if this is not the latest rust version on your machine, cargo commands may require an override in order to use the correct version.
 
On Linux systems you may need to install libssl-dev, pkg-config, zlib1g-dev, etc. On Ubuntu:

simdjson : Parsing gigabytes of JSON per second
 
 JSON is everywhere on the Internet. Servers spend a *lot* of time parsing it. We need a fresh approach. The simdjson library uses commonly available SIMD instructions and microparallel algorithms to parse JSON 4x faster than RapidJSON and 25x faster than JSON for Modern C++. 
 
 
Fast: Over 4x faster than commonly used production-grade JSON parsers.
 
 
Record Breaking Features: Minify JSON at 6 GB/s, validate UTF-8 at 13 GB/s, NDJSON at 3.5 GB/s.
 
 
Easy: First-class, easy to use and carefully documented APIs.
 
 
Strict: Full JSON and UTF-8 validation, lossless parsing. Performance with no compromises.
 
 
Automatic: Selects a CPU-tailored parser at runtime. No configuration needed.

v86 emulates an x86-compatible CPU and hardware. Machine code is translated to WebAssembly modules at runtime in order to achieve decent performance. Here&#x27;s a list of emulated hardware:
 
 
 
An x86-compatible CPU. The instruction set is around Pentium III level, including full SSE2 support. Some features are missing, in particular: 
  
 
   
Task gates, far calls in protected mode
 
   
Some 16 bit protected mode features
 
   
Single stepping (trap flag, debug registers)
 
   
Some exceptions, especially floating point and SSE
 
   
Multicore
 
   
PAE
 
   
64-bit extensions

Usage
 
The preferred way to configure the miner is the JSON config file as it is more flexible and human friendly. The command line interface does not cover all features, such as mining profiles for different algorithms. Important options can be changed during runtime without miner restart by editing the config file or executing API calls.
 
 
 
Wizard helps you create initial configuration for the miner.
 
 
Workers helps manage your miners via HTTP API.

Welcome to dotnet sdk
 
This repo contains core functionality needed to create .NET projects that is shared between VisualStudio and CLI.
 
 
 
MSBuild tasks can be found under /src/Tasks/Microsoft.NET.Build.Tasks/.
 
 
Please refer to dotnet/project-system for the project system work that is specific to Visual Studio.

Latest builds
 
How do I engage and contribute?
 
We welcome you to try things out, file issues, make feature requests and join us in design conversations. Also be sure to check out our project documentation
 
This project has adopted the .NET Foundation Code of Conduct to clarify expected behavior in our community.
 
How do I build the SDK?
 
Start with the Developer Guide.
 
How do I test an SDK I have built?
 
To test your locally built SDK, run eng\dogfood.cmd after building. That script starts a new Powershell with the environment configured to redirect SDK resolution to your build.
 
From that shell your SDK will be available in:
 
 
 
any Visual Studio instance launched (via &amp; devenv.exe)
 
 
dotnet build
 
 
msbuild
 
 
How we triage and review PRs
 
With the SDK repo being the home for many different areas, we&#x27;ve started trying to label incoming issues for the area they are related to using Area- labels. Then we rely on the codeowners to manage and triages issues in their areas. Feel free to ping the owners listed in that file if you&#x27;re not getting traction on a particular issue or PR. Please try to label new issues as that&#x27;ll help us route them faster.
 
For PRs, we assign out a reviewer once a week on Wednesday looking only at PRs that are green in the build. If you are contributing, please get the PR green including a test if possible and then ping @dotnet-cli if you want to raise visibility of the PR.</span>

Chatwoot is an open-source omnichannel customer support software. The development of Chatwoot started in 2016. It failed to succeed as a business and eventually shut up shop in 2017. During 2019 #Hacktoberfest, the maintainers decided to make it open-source, instead of letting the code rust in a private repo. With a pleasant surprise, Chatwoot became a trending project on Hacker News and best of all, got lots of love from the community. Now, a failed project is back on track and the prospects are looking great. The team is back to working on …</span>

This package contains an OCR engine - libtesseract and a command line program - tesseract. Tesseract 4 adds a new neural net (LSTM) based OCR engine which is focused on line recognition, but also still supports the legacy Tesseract OCR engine of Tesseract 3 which works by recognizing character patterns. Compatibility with Tesseract 3 is enabled by using the Legacy OCR Engine mode (--oem 0). It also needs traineddata files which support the legacy engine, for example those…</span>

                    <span>A unique technique to execute binaries from a password protected zip

ZipExec
 
ZipExec is a Proof-of-Concept (POC) tool to wrap binary-based tools into a password-protected zip file. This zip file is then base64 encoded into a string that is rebuilt on disk. This encoded string is then loaded into a JScript file that when executed, would rebuild the password-protected zip file on disk and execute it. This is done programmatically by using COM objects to access the GUI-based functions in Windows via the generated JScript loader, executing the loader inside the password-protected zip without having to unzip it first. By password protecting the zip file, it protects the binary from EDRs and disk-based or anti-malware scanning mechanisms.
 
 
Installation
 
The first step as always is to clone the repo. Before you compile ZipExec you&#x27;ll need to install the dependencies. To install them, run following commands:
 
go get github.com/yeka/zip

 
Then build it
 
go build ZipExec.go

 
or
 
go get github.com/Tylous/ZipExec 
 
Help
 
./ZipExec -h

                    <span>Super_Mario
 
 
 
Hello all this is a simple python program which tries to use our body as a controller for the super mario game
 
 
Here I have used media pipe to detect the body posture
 
 
then based on the based posture I have stimulated the keyboard input using pynput module of the python
 
 
as single press of the key is not sufficient to make the mario move I have used multithreading concept to simulataneously run different methods
 
 
In order to run this program in your machine just install the dependencies like opencv, mediapipe, pynput and run the main.py file
 
 
after that stand in front of the camera in center position
 
 
Thats it you are good to go now</span>

                    <span>This is a crypto trading bot that scans the Binance Annoucements page for new coins, and places trades on Gateio

gateio-trading-bot-binance-announcements
 
This Gateio x Binance cryptocurrency trading bot scans the Binance Announcements page and picks up on new coin listings. It then goes to Gateio and places a buy order on the coin that&#x27;s due to be listed on Binance. It comes with trailing stop loss, take profit and a test mode.
 
The idea behind this open source crypto trading algorithm to take advantage of the price spike of new coins as they are being announced for listing on Binance. As Gateio seems to list many of these coins before Binance does, this exchange is a good place to start. It comes with a live and test mode so naturally, use at your own risk.
 
 
 
For a step-by-step guide on how to set it up and configure please see the guide here: Binance new coin trading bot guide

Pixie is an open source observability tool for Kubernetes applications. Use Pixie to view the high-level state of your cluster (service maps, cluster resources, application traffic) and also drill-down into more detailed views (pod state, flame graphs, individual full-body application requests).
 
Why Pixie?
 
Three features enable Pixie&#x27;s magical developer experience:
 
 
 
 Auto-telemetry: Pixie uses eBPF to automatically collect telemetry data such as full-body requests, resource and network metrics, application profiles, and more. See the full list of data sources here.
  
 
 In-Cluster Edge Compute: Pixie collects, stores and queries all telemetry data locally in the cluster. Pixie uses less than 5% of cluster CPU, …</span>

Polkadot
 
Implementation of a https://polkadot.network node in Rust based on the Substrate framework.
 
 
 
NOTE: In 2018, we split our implementation of &quot;Polkadot&quot; from its development framework &quot;Substrate&quot;. See the Substrate repo for git history prior to 2018.
 
 
This repo contains runtimes for the Polkadot, Kusama, and Westend networks. The README provides information about installing the polkadot binary and developing on the codebase. For more specific guides, like how to be a validator, see the Polkadot Wiki.
 
Installation
 
If you just wish to run a Polkadot node without compiling it yourself, you may either run the latest binary from our releases page, or install Polkadot from one of our package repositories.

Non-deep Networks 
 arXiv:2110.07641 
 Ankit Goyal, Alexey Bochkovskiy, Jia Deng, Vladlen Koltun
 
 
 Overview: Depth is the hallmark of DNNs. But more depth means more sequential computation and higher latency. This begs the question -- is it possible to build high-performing &#x60;&#x60;non-deep&quot; neural networks? We show that it is. We show, for the first time, that a network with a depth of just 12 can achieve top-1 accuracy over 80% on ImageNet, 96% on CIFAR10, and 81% on CIFAR100. We also show that a network with a low-depth (12) backbone can achieve an AP of 48% on MS-COCO.

What is PolarDB-X ？
 
PolarDB-X is a cloud native distributed SQL Database designed for high concurrency, massive storage, complex querying scenarios. It has a shared-nothing architecture in which computing is decoupled from storage. It supports horizontal scaling, distributed transactions and Hybrid Transactional and Analytical Processing (HTAP) workloads, and is characterized by enterprise-class, cloud native, high availability, highly compatiable with MySQL and its ecosystem.
 
PolarDB-X was originally created to solve the database&#x27;s scalability bottleneck of Alibaba Tmall&#x27;s &quot;Double Eleven&quot; core transaction system, and has grown with AliCloud along…</span>

Much of this guide is specific to Voron printers running Klipper. Rather than re-hashing concepts already described in Voron/Klipper documentation, I will be frequently linking to them and adding additional information and methods that utilize those concepts.
 
This is not intended to be an ultimate guide to everything, rather a guide to address common mistakes and confusion I see in the Voron Discord.
 
(!) Please pay special attention to anything bolded and marked with &quot;(!)&quot;
 
My SuperSlicer profiles are located here.
 
I am adding new information all the time, be sure to check back.
 If you have issues, comments, or suggestions, please let me know on Discord: Ellis#4980

Lottie is a mobile library for Android and iOS that natively renders vector based animations and art in realtime with minimal code.
 
Lottie loads and renders animations and vectors exported in the bodymovin JSON format. Bodymovin JSON can be created and exported from After Effects with bodymovin, Sketch with Lottie Sketch Export, and from Haiku.
 
For the first time, designers can create and ship beautiful animations without an engineer painstakingly recreating it by hand. Since the animation is backed by JSON they are extremely small in size but can be large in complexity! Animations can be pla…</span>

Coding Interview University
 
 
 
I originally created this as a short to-do list of study topics for becoming a software engineer, but it grew to the large list you see today. After going through this study plan, I got hired as a Software Development Engineer at Amazon! You probably won&#x27;t have to study as much as I did. Anyway, everything you need is here.
 
 
I studied about 8-12 hours a day, for several months. This is my story: Why I studied full-time for 8 months for a Google interview
 
 
Please Note: You won&#x27;t need to study as much as I did. I wasted a lot of time on things I didn&#x27;t need to know. More info about that below. I&#x27;ll help you get there without wasting your precious time.

MuJoCo Physics
 
MuJoCo stands for Multi-Joint dynamics with Contact. It is a general purpose physics engine that aims to facilitate research and development in robotics, biomechanics, graphics and animation, machine learning, and other areas which demand fast and accurate simulation of articulated structures interacting with their environment.
 
DeepMind has acquired MuJoCo, and we are currently making preparations to open source the codebase. In the meantime, MuJoCo is available for download as a free and unrestricted precompiled binary under the Apache 2.0 license from mujoco.org.
 
MuJoCo&#x27;s source code will be released through this GitHub repository once it is ready. In the meantime, the repository hosts MuJoCo&#x27;s …</span>

                    <span>A cross-platform, customizable science fiction terminal emulator with advanced monitoring &amp; touchscreen support.

   
  
    
      
 (Project archived oct. 18th 2021) 

  
eDEX-UI is a fullscreen, cross-platform terminal emulator and system monitor that looks and feels like a sci-fi computer interface.
 
 
   
Heavily inspired from the TRON Legacy movie effects (especially the Board Room sequence), the eDEX-UI project was originally meant to be &quot;DEX-UI with less « art » and more « distributable software »&quot;.
 
While keeping a futuristic look and feel, it strives to maintain a certain level of functionality and to be usable in real-life scenarios, with the larger goal of bringing science-fiction UXs to the mainstream.
 
 
It might or might not be a joke taken too seriously.

What is Datree?
 
Datree is a CLI tool that supports Kubernetes admins in their roles by preventing developers from making errors in Kubernetes configurations that can cause clusters to fail in production. Our CLI tool is open source, enabling it to be supported by the Kubernetes community.
 
It’s far more effective than manual processes, such as sending an email to a slew of developers, begging them to set various limits, which likely falls on deaf ears because developers are already overwhelmed.

What is JAX?
 
JAX is Autograd and XLA, brought together for high-performance machine learning research.
 
With its updated version of Autograd, JAX can automatically differentiate native Python and NumPy functions. It can differentiate through loops, branches, recursion, and closures, and it can take derivatives of derivatives of derivatives. It supports reverse-mode differentiation (a.k.a. backpropagation) via grad as well as forward-mode differentiation, and the two can be composed arbitr…</span>

Puppeteer
 
 
 
 
 
 
API | FAQ | Contributing | Troubleshooting
 
 
 
Puppeteer is a Node library which provides a high-level API to control Chrome or Chromium over the DevTools Protocol. Puppeteer runs headless by default, but can be configured to run full (non-headless) Chrome or Chromium.
 
 
 
What can I do?
 
Most things that you can do manually in the browser can be done using Puppeteer! Here are a few examples to get you started:
 
 
 
Generate screenshots and PDFs of pages.
 
 
Crawl a SPA (Single-Page Application) and generate pre-rendered content (i.e. &quot;SSR&quot; (Server-Side Rendering)).

Slate lets you build rich, intuitive editors like those in Medium, Dropbox Paper or Google Docs—which are becoming table stakes for applications on the web—without your codebase getting mired in complexity.
 
It can do this because all of its logic is implemented with a series of plugins, so you aren&#x27;t ever constrained by what is or isn&#x27;t in &quot;core&quot;. You can think of it like a pluggable implementation of contenteditable built on top of React. It was inspired by libraries like Draft.js, Prosemirror and Quill.

📚 Awesome cheatsheets for popular programming languages, frameworks and development tools. They include everything you should know in one single file.
 
 
🤔 Why Awesome-Cheatsheets?
 
I usually make a cheat sheet when I want to improve my skills in a programming language, a framework or a development tool. I started doing these kinds of things a long time ago on Gist. To better keep track of the history and to let people contribute, I reorganized all of them into this single repository. Most of the content is coming from official documentation and some books I have read.

关于下载
 
目前还在规范整个流程，权限，合法性，也有在联系律师同学的帮助，在规范完之后会开放下载。请各位放心！
 
项目介绍
 
Worker Lives Matter！ WorkingTime 是由中国民间程序员发起的一个项目，针对目前包括互联网企业在内的各个企业加班盛行且无监管的现状，上线了一个在线作息编辑表格。上线仅两天就收获了上千条各个企业精确到部门的作息情况和工作氛围等信息，几十万的浏览次数，上百人同时在线查看。随着文档的扩散，打工人们分享的信息中不仅局限于互联网企业，还包含了金融行业，事业单位，建筑行业等各行各业企业部门的作息情况，我们打工人也需要生活！！！！
 
此项目依托于各位打工人们的无私奉献，旨在为在各行各业的打工人提供各个公司的作息时间，为打工人们在做职业选择的时候提供尽量准确的参考。
 
大家分享的信息我们也会定时在此仓库进行更新，造福打工人！
 
如何奉献自己的一份力
 
我们在维护此项目期间收到了很多仁人志士的帮助和建议，在此先感谢所有为此项目提供数据和为此项目建言献策的各位同胞！
 
然后，如果您愿意分享自己部门的作息情况，请点击 https://docs.qq.com/form/page/DUUdPbWhnWVF3ekh6 此问卷，发布自己公司部门的作息时间以及其他信息。（本来之前是直接在表格编辑，但是遭到了不怀好意者的恶意增删，所以我们只能以填问卷的形式自动增加内容，望同胞们理解！）

Overview
 
Prompt-learning is the latest paradigm to adapt pre-trained language models (PLMs) to downstream NLP tasks, which modifies the input text with a textual template and directly uses PLMs to conduct pre-trained tasks. This library provides a standard, flexible and extensible framework to deploy the prompt-learning pipeline. OpenPrompt supports loading PLMs directly from huggingface transformers. In the future, we will also support PLMs implemented by other libraries.

Abstract: We observe that despite their hierarchical convolutional nature, the synthesis process of typical generative adversarial networks depends on absolute pixel coordinates in an unhealthy manner. This manifests itself as, e.g., detail appearing to be glued to image coordinates instead of the surfaces of depicted objects. We trace the root cause to careless signal processing that causes aliasing in the generator network. Interpreting all signals…</span>

Rate-limiting
 
Facebook will temp-block you if you make too many requests too quickly. Run the command with the -rateLimit  to introduce a delay before each request. If you&#x27;re getting hung up on just searches or deletes, you can disable rate-limiting for one or the other with -limitSearch&#x3D;0 or -limitDelete&#x3D;0.
 
E.g. one of:
 
$ ./deleter-linux -rateLimit 500
$ ./deleter-linux -rateLimit 500 -limitSearch&#x3D;0
$ ./deleter-linux -rateLimit 500 -limitDelete&#x3D;0</span>
